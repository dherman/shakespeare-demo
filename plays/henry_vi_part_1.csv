I,I,BEDFORD,"Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Comets, importing change of times and states,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"And with them scourge the bad revolting stars"
I,I,BEDFORD,"That have consented unto Henry's death!"
I,I,BEDFORD,"King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!"
I,I,BEDFORD,"England ne'er lost a king of so much worth."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"England ne'er had a king until his time."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Virtue he had, deserving to command:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"More dazzled and drove back his enemies"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered."
I,I,EXETER,"We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?"
I,I,EXETER,"Henry is dead and never shall revive:"
I,I,EXETER,"Upon a wooden coffin we attend,"
I,I,EXETER,"And death's dishonourable victory"
I,I,EXETER,"We with our stately presence glorify,"
I,I,EXETER,"Like captives bound to a triumphant car."
I,I,EXETER,"What! shall we curse the planets of mishap"
I,I,EXETER,"That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?"
I,I,EXETER,"Or shall we think the subtle-witted French"
I,I,EXETER,"Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him"
I,I,EXETER,"By magic verses have contrived his end?"
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"He was a king bless'd of the King of kings."
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day"
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"So dreadful will not be as was his sight."
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:"
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"The church's prayers made him so prosperous."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"None do you like but an effeminate prince,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe."
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector"
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"And lookest to command the prince and realm."
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,"
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"More than God or religious churchmen may."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Except it be to pray against thy foes."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Posterity, await for wretched years,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"And none but women left to wail the dead."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!"
I,I,BEDFORD,"A far more glorious star thy soul will make"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Than Julius Caesar or bright--"
I,I,Messenger,"My honourable lords, health to you all!"
I,I,Messenger,"Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,"
I,I,Messenger,"Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:"
I,I,Messenger,"Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,"
I,I,Messenger,"Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost."
I,I,BEDFORD,"What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Will make him burst his lead and rise from death."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"If Henry were recall'd to life again,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"These news would cause him once more yield the ghost."
I,I,EXETER,"How were they lost? what treachery was used?"
I,I,Messenger,"No treachery; but want of men and money."
I,I,Messenger,"Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,"
I,I,Messenger,"That here you maintain several factions,"
I,I,Messenger,"And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,"
I,I,Messenger,"You are disputing of your generals:"
I,I,Messenger,"One would have lingering wars with little cost;"
I,I,Messenger,"Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;"
I,I,Messenger,"A third thinks, without expense at all,"
I,I,Messenger,"By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd."
I,I,Messenger,"Awake, awake, English nobility!"
I,I,Messenger,"Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:"
I,I,Messenger,"Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;"
I,I,Messenger,"Of England's coat one half is cut away."
I,I,EXETER,"Were our tears wanting to this funeral,"
I,I,EXETER,"These tidings would call forth their flowing tides."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Me they concern; Regent I am of France."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"To weep their intermissive miseries."
I,I,Messenger,"Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance."
I,I,Messenger,"France is revolted from the English quite,"
I,I,Messenger,"Except some petty towns of no import:"
I,I,Messenger,"The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;"
I,I,Messenger,"The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;"
I,I,Messenger,"Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;"
I,I,Messenger,"The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side."
I,I,EXETER,"The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!"
I,I,EXETER,"O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?"
I,I,BEDFORD,"An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Wherewith already France is overrun."
I,I,Messenger,"My gracious lords, to add to your laments,"
I,I,Messenger,"Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,"
I,I,Messenger,"I must inform you of a dismal fight"
I,I,Messenger,"Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French."
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?"
I,I,Messenger,"O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:"
I,I,Messenger,"The circumstance I'll tell you more at large."
I,I,Messenger,"The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,"
I,I,Messenger,"Retiring from the siege of Orleans,"
I,I,Messenger,"Having full scarce six thousand in his troop."
I,I,Messenger,"By three and twenty thousand of the French"
I,I,Messenger,"Was round encompassed and set upon."
I,I,Messenger,"No leisure had he to enrank his men;"
I,I,Messenger,"He wanted pikes to set before his archers;"
I,I,Messenger,"Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges"
I,I,Messenger,"They pitched in the ground confusedly,"
I,I,Messenger,"To keep the horsemen off from breaking in."
I,I,Messenger,"More than three hours the fight continued;"
I,I,Messenger,"Where valiant Talbot above human thought"
I,I,Messenger,"Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:"
I,I,Messenger,"Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;"
I,I,Messenger,"Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:"
I,I,Messenger,"The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;"
I,I,Messenger,"All the whole army stood agazed on him:"
I,I,Messenger,"His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit"
I,I,Messenger,"A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain"
I,I,Messenger,"And rush'd into the bowels of the battle."
I,I,Messenger,"Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,"
I,I,Messenger,"If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:"
I,I,Messenger,"He, being in the vaward, placed behind"
I,I,Messenger,"With purpose to relieve and follow them,"
I,I,Messenger,"Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke."
I,I,Messenger,"Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;"
I,I,Messenger,"Enclosed were they with their enemies:"
I,I,Messenger,"A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,"
I,I,Messenger,"Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,"
I,I,Messenger,"Whom all France with their chief assembled strength"
I,I,Messenger,"Durst not presume to look once in the face."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"For living idly here in pomp and ease,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd."
I,I,Messenger,"O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,"
I,I,Messenger,"And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:"
I,I,Messenger,"Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise."
I,I,BEDFORD,"His ransom there is none but I shall pay:"
I,I,BEDFORD,"I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:"
I,I,BEDFORD,"His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours."
I,I,BEDFORD,"Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake."
I,I,Messenger,"So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;"
I,I,Messenger,"The English army is grown weak and faint:"
I,I,Messenger,"The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,"
I,I,Messenger,"And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,"
I,I,Messenger,"Since they, so few, watch such a multitude."
I,I,EXETER,"Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,"
I,I,EXETER,"Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,"
I,I,EXETER,"Or bring him in obedience to your yoke."
I,I,BEDFORD,"I do remember it; and here take my leave,"
I,I,BEDFORD,"To go about my preparation."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"To view the artillery and munition;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And then I will proclaim young Henry king."
I,I,EXETER,"To Eltham will I, where the young king is,"
I,I,EXETER,"Being ordain'd his special governor,"
I,I,EXETER,"And for his safety there I'll best devise."
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Each hath his place and function to attend:"
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"I am left out; for me nothing remains."
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"But long I will not be Jack out of office:"
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"The king from Eltham I intend to steal"
I,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"And sit at chiefest stern of public weal."
I,II,CHARLES,"Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens"
I,II,CHARLES,"So in the earth, to this day is not known:"
I,II,CHARLES,"Late did he shine upon the English side;"
I,II,CHARLES,"Now we are victors; upon us he smiles."
I,II,CHARLES,"What towns of any moment but we have?"
I,II,CHARLES,"At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;"
I,II,CHARLES,"Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,"
I,II,CHARLES,"Faintly besiege us one hour in a month."
I,II,ALENCON,"They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:"
I,II,ALENCON,"Either they must be dieted like mules"
I,II,ALENCON,"And have their provender tied to their mouths"
I,II,ALENCON,"Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice."
I,II,REIGNIER,"Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?"
I,II,REIGNIER,"Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:"
I,II,REIGNIER,"Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;"
I,II,REIGNIER,"And he may well in fretting spend his gall,"
I,II,REIGNIER,"Nor men nor money hath he to make war."
I,II,CHARLES,"Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them."
I,II,CHARLES,"Now for the honour of the forlorn French!"
I,II,CHARLES,"Him I forgive my death that killeth me"
I,II,CHARLES,"When he sees me go back one foot or fly."
I,II,CHARLES,"Who ever saw the like? what men have I!"
I,II,CHARLES,"Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,"
I,II,CHARLES,"But that they left me 'midst my enemies."
I,II,REIGNIER,"Salisbury is a desperate homicide;"
I,II,REIGNIER,"He fighteth as one weary of his life."
I,II,REIGNIER,"The other lords, like lions wanting food,"
I,II,REIGNIER,"Do rush upon us as their hungry prey."
I,II,ALENCON,"Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,"
I,II,ALENCON,"England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,"
I,II,ALENCON,"During the time Edward the Third did reign."
I,II,ALENCON,"More truly now may this be verified;"
I,II,ALENCON,"For none but Samsons and Goliases"
I,II,ALENCON,"It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!"
I,II,ALENCON,"Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose"
I,II,ALENCON,"They had such courage and audacity?"
I,II,CHARLES,"Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,"
I,II,CHARLES,"And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:"
I,II,CHARLES,"Of old I know them; rather with their teeth"
I,II,CHARLES,"The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege."
I,II,REIGNIER,"I think, by some odd gimmors or device"
I,II,REIGNIER,"Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;"
I,II,REIGNIER,"Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do."
I,II,REIGNIER,"By my consent, we'll even let them alone."
I,II,ALENCON,"Be it so."
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him."
I,II,CHARLES,"Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us."
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"A holy maid hither with me I bring,"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Which by a vision sent to her from heaven"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Ordained is to raise this tedious siege"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"And drive the English forth the bounds of France."
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"What's past and what's to come she can descry."
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,"
I,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"For they are certain and unfallible."
I,II,CHARLES,"Go, call her in."
I,II,CHARLES,"But first, to try her skill,"
I,II,CHARLES,"Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:"
I,II,CHARLES,"Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:"
I,II,CHARLES,"By this means shall we sound what skill she hath."
I,II,REIGNIER,"Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I know thee well, though never seen before."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"In private will I talk with thee apart."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile."
I,II,REIGNIER,"She takes upon her bravely at first dash."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"My wit untrain'd in any kind of art."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To shine on my contemptible estate:"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"God's mother deigned to appear to me"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And in a vision full of majesty"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Will'd me to leave my base vocation"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And free my country from calamity:"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Her aid she promised and assured success:"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"In complete glory she reveal'd herself;"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And, whereas I was black and swart before,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"With those clear rays which she infused on me"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That beauty am I bless'd with which you see."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Ask me what question thou canst possible,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And I will answer unpremeditated:"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"My courage try by combat, if thou darest,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"If thou receive me for thy warlike mate."
I,II,CHARLES,"Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:"
I,II,CHARLES,"Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,"
I,II,CHARLES,"In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,"
I,II,CHARLES,"And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;"
I,II,CHARLES,"Otherwise I renounce all confidence."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"churchyard,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth."
I,II,CHARLES,"Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man."
I,II,CHARLES,"Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon"
I,II,CHARLES,"And fightest with the sword of Deborah."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak."
I,II,CHARLES,"Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:"
I,II,CHARLES,"Impatiently I burn with thy desire;"
I,II,CHARLES,"My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued."
I,II,CHARLES,"Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,"
I,II,CHARLES,"Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:"
I,II,CHARLES,"'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I must not yield to any rites of love,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"For my profession's sacred from above:"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"When I have chased all thy foes from hence,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then will I think upon a recompense."
I,II,CHARLES,"Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall."
I,II,REIGNIER,"My lord, methinks, is very long in talk."
I,II,ALENCON,"Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;"
I,II,ALENCON,"Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech."
I,II,REIGNIER,"Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?"
I,II,ALENCON,"He may mean more than we poor men do know:"
I,II,ALENCON,"These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues."
I,II,REIGNIER,"My lord, where are you? what devise you on?"
I,II,REIGNIER,"Shall we give over Orleans, or no?"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard."
I,II,CHARLES,"What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Assign'd am I to be the English scourge."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Since I have entered into these wars."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Glory is like a circle in the water,"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"With Henry's death the English circle ends;"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Dispersed are the glories it included."
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Now am I like that proud insulting ship"
I,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once."
I,II,CHARLES,"Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?"
I,II,CHARLES,"Thou with an eagle art inspired then."
I,II,CHARLES,"Helen, the mother of great Constantine,"
I,II,CHARLES,"Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee."
I,II,CHARLES,"Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,"
I,II,CHARLES,"How may I reverently worship thee enough?"
I,II,ALENCON,"Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege."
I,II,REIGNIER,"Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;"
I,II,REIGNIER,"Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized."
I,II,CHARLES,"Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:"
I,II,CHARLES,"No prophet will I trust, if she prove false."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I am come to survey the Tower this day:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Where be these warders, that they wait not here?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls."
I,III,First Serving-Man,"It is the noble Duke of Gloucester."
I,III,First Serving-Man,"Villains, answer you so the lord protector?"
I,III,First Warder,"We do no otherwise than we are will'd."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"There's none protector of the realm but I."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?"
I,III,WOODVILE,"What noise is this? what traitors have we here?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter."
I,III,WOODVILE,"Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;"
I,III,WOODVILE,"The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:"
I,III,WOODVILE,"From him I have express commandment"
I,III,WOODVILE,"That thou nor none of thine shall be let in."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Thou art no friend to God or to the king:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly."
I,III,Serving-Men,"Open the gates unto the lord protector,"
I,III,Serving-Men,"Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly."
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"I do, thou most usurping proditor,"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"And not protector, of the king or realm."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"If thou proceed in this thy insolence."
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I'll use to carry thee out of this place."
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"What! am I dared and bearded to my face?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Draw, men, for all this privileged place;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"In spite of pope or dignities of church,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down."
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!"
I,III,Mayor,"Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,"
I,III,Mayor,"Thus contumeliously should break the peace!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use."
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"One that still motions war and never peace,"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"That seeks to overthrow religion,"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Because he is protector of the realm,"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"And would have armour here out of the Tower,"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"To crown himself king and suppress the prince."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I will not answer thee with words, but blows."
I,III,Mayor,"Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife"
I,III,Mayor,"But to make open proclamation:"
I,III,Mayor,"Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,"
I,III,Mayor,"Cry."
I,III,Officer,"All manner of men assembled here in arms this day"
I,III,Officer,"against God's peace and the king's, we charge and"
I,III,Officer,"command you, in his highness' name, to repair to"
I,III,Officer,"your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,"
I,III,Officer,"handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,"
I,III,Officer,"henceforward, upon pain of death."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"But we shall meet, and break our minds at large."
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work."
I,III,Mayor,"I'll call for clubs, if you will not away."
I,III,Mayor,"This cardinal's more haughty than the devil."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst."
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;"
I,III,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"For I intend to have it ere long."
I,III,Mayor,"See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart."
I,III,Mayor,"Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!"
I,III,Mayor,"I myself fight not once in forty year."
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"And how the English have the suburbs won."
I,IV,Boy,"Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,"
I,IV,Boy,"Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim."
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"Chief master-gunner am I of this town;"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"Something I must do to procure me grace."
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"The prince's espials have informed me"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"And thence discover how with most advantage"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"They may vex us with shot, or with assault."
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"To intercept this inconvenience,"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"And even these three days have I watch'd,"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"If I could see them."
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer."
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;"
I,IV,Master-Gunner,"And thou shalt find me at the governor's."
I,IV,Boy,"Father, I warrant you; take you no care;"
I,IV,Boy,"I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them."
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"How wert thou handled being prisoner?"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Or by what means got'st thou to be released?"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top."
I,IV,TALBOT,"The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;"
I,IV,TALBOT,"For him was I exchanged and ransomed."
I,IV,TALBOT,"But with a baser man of arms by far"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd."
I,IV,TALBOT,"In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired."
I,IV,TALBOT,"But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Whom with my bare fists I would execute,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"If I now had him brought into my power."
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd."
I,IV,TALBOT,"With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts."
I,IV,TALBOT,"In open market-place produced they me,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"To be a public spectacle to all:"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Here, said they, is the terror of the French,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"The scarecrow that affrights our children so."
I,IV,TALBOT,"Then broke I from the officers that led me,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"To hurl at the beholders of my shame:"
I,IV,TALBOT,"My grisly countenance made others fly;"
I,IV,TALBOT,"None durst come near for fear of sudden death."
I,IV,TALBOT,"In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;"
I,IV,TALBOT,"So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"That walked about me every minute-while;"
I,IV,TALBOT,"And if I did but stir out of my bed,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Ready they were to shoot me to the heart."
I,IV,SALISBURY,"I grieve to hear what torments you endured,"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"But we will be revenged sufficiently"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Now it is supper-time in Orleans:"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Here, through this grate, I count each one"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee."
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Let me have your express opinions"
I,IV,SALISBURY,"Where is best place to make our battery next."
I,IV,GARGRAVE,"I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords."
I,IV,GLANSDALE,"And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge."
I,IV,TALBOT,"For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Or with light skirmishes enfeebled."
I,IV,SALISBURY,"O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!"
I,IV,GARGRAVE,"O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!"
I,IV,TALBOT,"What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:"
I,IV,TALBOT,"How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?"
I,IV,TALBOT,"One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand"
I,IV,TALBOT,"That hath contrived this woful tragedy!"
I,IV,TALBOT,"In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field."
I,IV,TALBOT,"Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:"
I,IV,TALBOT,"The sun with one eye vieweth all the world."
I,IV,TALBOT,"Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it."
I,IV,TALBOT,"Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him."
I,IV,TALBOT,"Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Thou shalt not die whiles--"
I,IV,TALBOT,"He beckons with his hand and smiles on me."
I,IV,TALBOT,"As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Remember to avenge me on the French.'"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Wretched shall France be only in my name."
I,IV,TALBOT,"What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?"
I,IV,Messenger,"My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:"
I,IV,Messenger,"The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,"
I,IV,Messenger,"A holy prophetess new risen up,"
I,IV,Messenger,"Is come with a great power to raise the siege."
I,IV,TALBOT,"Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!"
I,IV,TALBOT,"It irks his heart he cannot be revenged."
I,IV,TALBOT,"Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"And make a quagmire of your mingled brains."
I,IV,TALBOT,"Convey me Salisbury into his tent,"
I,IV,TALBOT,"And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare."
I,V,TALBOT,"Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?"
I,V,TALBOT,"Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:"
I,V,TALBOT,"A woman clad in armour chaseth them."
I,V,TALBOT,"Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;"
I,V,TALBOT,"Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:"
I,V,TALBOT,"Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,"
I,V,TALBOT,"And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest."
I,V,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee."
I,V,TALBOT,"Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?"
I,V,TALBOT,"My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage"
I,V,TALBOT,"And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder."
I,V,TALBOT,"But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet."
I,V,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:"
I,V,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I must go victual Orleans forthwith."
I,V,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O'ertake me, if thou canst; I scorn thy strength."
I,V,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men;"
I,V,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Help Salisbury to make his testament:"
I,V,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"This day is ours, as many more shall be."
I,V,TALBOT,"My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;"
I,V,TALBOT,"I know not where I am, nor what I do;"
I,V,TALBOT,"A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,"
I,V,TALBOT,"Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:"
I,V,TALBOT,"So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench"
I,V,TALBOT,"Are from their hives and houses driven away."
I,V,TALBOT,"They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;"
I,V,TALBOT,"Now, like to whelps, we crying run away."
I,V,TALBOT,"Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,"
I,V,TALBOT,"Or tear the lions out of England's coat;"
I,V,TALBOT,"Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:"
I,V,TALBOT,"Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,"
I,V,TALBOT,"Or horse or oxen from the leopard,"
I,V,TALBOT,"As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves."
I,V,TALBOT,"It will not be: retire into your trenches:"
I,V,TALBOT,"You all consented unto Salisbury's death,"
I,V,TALBOT,"For none would strike a stroke in his revenge."
I,V,TALBOT,"Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,"
I,V,TALBOT,"In spite of us or aught that we could do."
I,V,TALBOT,"O, would I were to die with Salisbury!"
I,V,TALBOT,"The shame hereof will make me hide my head."
I,VI,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Advance our waving colours on the walls;"
I,VI,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Rescued is Orleans from the English"
I,VI,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word."
I,VI,CHARLES,"Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,"
I,VI,CHARLES,"How shall I honour thee for this success?"
I,VI,CHARLES,"Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens"
I,VI,CHARLES,"That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next."
I,VI,CHARLES,"France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!"
I,VI,CHARLES,"Recover'd is the town of Orleans:"
I,VI,CHARLES,"More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state."
I,VI,REIGNIER,"Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?"
I,VI,REIGNIER,"Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires"
I,VI,REIGNIER,"And feast and banquet in the open streets,"
I,VI,REIGNIER,"To celebrate the joy that God hath given us."
I,VI,ALENCON,"All France will be replete with mirth and joy,"
I,VI,ALENCON,"When they shall hear how we have play'd the men."
I,VI,CHARLES,"'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;"
I,VI,CHARLES,"For which I will divide my crown with her,"
I,VI,CHARLES,"And all the priests and friars in my realm"
I,VI,CHARLES,"Shall in procession sing her endless praise."
I,VI,CHARLES,"A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear"
I,VI,CHARLES,"Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:"
I,VI,CHARLES,"In memory of her when she is dead,"
I,VI,CHARLES,"Her ashes, in an urn more precious"
I,VI,CHARLES,"Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,"
I,VI,CHARLES,"Transported shall be at high festivals"
I,VI,CHARLES,"Before the kings and queens of France."
I,VI,CHARLES,"No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,"
I,VI,CHARLES,"But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint."
I,VI,CHARLES,"Come in, and let us banquet royally,"
I,VI,CHARLES,"After this golden day of victory."
II,I,Sergeant,"Sirs, take your places and be vigilant:"
II,I,Sergeant,"If any noise or soldier you perceive"
II,I,Sergeant,"Near to the walls, by some apparent sign"
II,I,Sergeant,"Let us have knowledge at the court of guard."
II,I,First Sentinel,"Sergeant, you shall."
II,I,First Sentinel,"Thus are poor servitors,"
II,I,First Sentinel,"When others sleep upon their quiet beds,"
II,I,First Sentinel,"Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold."
II,I,TALBOT,"Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,"
II,I,TALBOT,"By whose approach the regions of Artois,"
II,I,TALBOT,"Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,"
II,I,TALBOT,"This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,"
II,I,TALBOT,"Having all day caroused and banqueted:"
II,I,TALBOT,"Embrace we then this opportunity"
II,I,TALBOT,"As fitting best to quittance their deceit"
II,I,TALBOT,"Contrived by art and baleful sorcery."
II,I,BEDFORD,"Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,"
II,I,BEDFORD,"Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,"
II,I,BEDFORD,"To join with witches and the help of hell!"
II,I,BURGUNDY,"Traitors have never other company."
II,I,BURGUNDY,"But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?"
II,I,TALBOT,"A maid, they say."
II,I,BEDFORD,"A maid! and be so martial!"
II,I,BURGUNDY,"Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,"
II,I,BURGUNDY,"If underneath the standard of the French"
II,I,BURGUNDY,"She carry armour as she hath begun."
II,I,TALBOT,"Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:"
II,I,TALBOT,"God is our fortress, in whose conquering name"
II,I,TALBOT,"Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks."
II,I,BEDFORD,"Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee."
II,I,TALBOT,"Not all together: better far, I guess,"
II,I,TALBOT,"That we do make our entrance several ways;"
II,I,TALBOT,"That, if it chance the one of us do fail,"
II,I,TALBOT,"The other yet may rise against their force."
II,I,BEDFORD,"Agreed: I'll to yond corner."
II,I,BURGUNDY,"And I to this."
II,I,TALBOT,"And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave."
II,I,TALBOT,"Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right"
II,I,TALBOT,"Of English Henry, shall this night appear"
II,I,TALBOT,"How much in duty I am bound to both."
II,I,Sentinels,"Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!"
II,I,ALENCON,"How now, my lords! what, all unready so?"
II,I,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well."
II,I,REIGNIER,"'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,"
II,I,REIGNIER,"Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors."
II,I,ALENCON,"Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,"
II,I,ALENCON,"Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise"
II,I,ALENCON,"More venturous or desperate than this."
II,I,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell."
II,I,REIGNIER,"If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him."
II,I,ALENCON,"Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped."
II,I,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard."
II,I,CHARLES,"Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?"
II,I,CHARLES,"Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,"
II,I,CHARLES,"Make us partakers of a little gain,"
II,I,CHARLES,"That now our loss might be ten times so much?"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"At all times will you have my power alike?"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"This sudden mischief never could have fall'n."
II,I,CHARLES,"Duke of Alencon, this was your default,"
II,I,CHARLES,"That, being captain of the watch to-night,"
II,I,CHARLES,"Did look no better to that weighty charge."
II,I,ALENCON,"Had all your quarters been as safely kept"
II,I,ALENCON,"As that whereof I had the government,"
II,I,ALENCON,"We had not been thus shamefully surprised."
II,I,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Mine was secure."
II,I,REIGNIER,"And so was mine, my lord."
II,I,CHARLES,"And, for myself, most part of all this night,"
II,I,CHARLES,"Within her quarter and mine own precinct"
II,I,CHARLES,"I was employ'd in passing to and fro,"
II,I,CHARLES,"About relieving of the sentinels:"
II,I,CHARLES,"Then how or which way should they first break in?"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Question, my lords, no further of the case,"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But weakly guarded, where the breach was made."
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And now there rests no other shift but this;"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,"
II,I,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And lay new platforms to endamage them."
II,I,Soldier,"I'll be so bold to take what they have left."
II,I,Soldier,"The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;"
II,I,Soldier,"For I have loaden me with many spoils,"
II,I,Soldier,"Using no other weapon but his name."
II,II,BEDFORD,"The day begins to break, and night is fled,"
II,II,BEDFORD,"Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth."
II,II,BEDFORD,"Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit."
II,II,TALBOT,"Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,"
II,II,TALBOT,"And here advance it in the market-place,"
II,II,TALBOT,"The middle centre of this cursed town."
II,II,TALBOT,"Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;"
II,II,TALBOT,"For every drop of blood was drawn from him,"
II,II,TALBOT,"There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight."
II,II,TALBOT,"And that hereafter ages may behold"
II,II,TALBOT,"What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,"
II,II,TALBOT,"Within their chiefest temple I'll erect"
II,II,TALBOT,"A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:"
II,II,TALBOT,"Upon the which, that every one may read,"
II,II,TALBOT,"Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,"
II,II,TALBOT,"The treacherous manner of his mournful death"
II,II,TALBOT,"And what a terror he had been to France."
II,II,TALBOT,"But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,"
II,II,TALBOT,"I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,"
II,II,TALBOT,"His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,"
II,II,TALBOT,"Nor any of his false confederates."
II,II,BEDFORD,"'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,"
II,II,BEDFORD,"Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,"
II,II,BEDFORD,"They did amongst the troops of armed men"
II,II,BEDFORD,"Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field."
II,II,BURGUNDY,"Myself, as far as I could well discern"
II,II,BURGUNDY,"For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,"
II,II,BURGUNDY,"Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,"
II,II,BURGUNDY,"When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,"
II,II,BURGUNDY,"Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves"
II,II,BURGUNDY,"That could not live asunder day or night."
II,II,BURGUNDY,"After that things are set in order here,"
II,II,BURGUNDY,"We'll follow them with all the power we have."
II,II,Messenger,"All hail, my lords! which of this princely train"
II,II,Messenger,"Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts"
II,II,Messenger,"So much applauded through the realm of France?"
II,II,TALBOT,"Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?"
II,II,Messenger,"The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,"
II,II,Messenger,"With modesty admiring thy renown,"
II,II,Messenger,"By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe"
II,II,Messenger,"To visit her poor castle where she lies,"
II,II,Messenger,"That she may boast she hath beheld the man"
II,II,Messenger,"Whose glory fills the world with loud report."
II,II,BURGUNDY,"Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars"
II,II,BURGUNDY,"Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,"
II,II,BURGUNDY,"When ladies crave to be encounter'd with."
II,II,BURGUNDY,"You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit."
II,II,TALBOT,"Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men"
II,II,TALBOT,"Could not prevail with all their oratory,"
II,II,TALBOT,"Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:"
II,II,TALBOT,"And therefore tell her I return great thanks,"
II,II,TALBOT,"And in submission will attend on her."
II,II,TALBOT,"Will not your honours bear me company?"
II,II,BEDFORD,"No, truly; it is more than manners will:"
II,II,BEDFORD,"And I have heard it said, unbidden guests"
II,II,BEDFORD,"Are often welcomest when they are gone."
II,II,TALBOT,"Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,"
II,II,TALBOT,"I mean to prove this lady's courtesy."
II,II,TALBOT,"Come hither, captain."
II,II,TALBOT,"You perceive my mind?"
II,II,Captain,"I do, my lord, and mean accordingly."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Porter, remember what I gave in charge;"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"And when you have done so, bring the keys to me."
II,III,Porter,"Madam, I will."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"I shall as famous be by this exploit"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"And his achievements of no less account:"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"To give their censure of these rare reports."
II,III,Messenger,"Madam,"
II,III,Messenger,"According as your ladyship desired,"
II,III,Messenger,"By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"And he is welcome. What! is this the man?"
II,III,Messenger,"Madam, it is."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Is this the scourge of France?"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"That with his name the mothers still their babes?"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"I see report is fabulous and false:"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"I thought I should have seen some Hercules,"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"A second Hector, for his grim aspect,"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Should strike such terror to his enemies."
II,III,TALBOT,"Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;"
II,III,TALBOT,"But since your ladyship is not at leisure,"
II,III,TALBOT,"I'll sort some other time to visit you."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes."
II,III,Messenger,"Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves"
II,III,Messenger,"To know the cause of your abrupt departure."
II,III,TALBOT,"Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,"
II,III,TALBOT,"I go to certify her Talbot's here."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"If thou be he, then art thou prisoner."
II,III,TALBOT,"Prisoner! to whom?"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"To me, blood-thirsty lord;"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"And for that cause I trained thee to my house."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"For in my gallery thy picture hangs:"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"But now the substance shall endure the like,"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"That hast by tyranny these many years"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Wasted our country, slain our citizens"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"And sent our sons and husbands captivate."
II,III,TALBOT,"Ha, ha, ha!"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan."
II,III,TALBOT,"I laugh to see your ladyship so fond"
II,III,TALBOT,"To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow"
II,III,TALBOT,"Whereon to practise your severity."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Why, art not thou the man?"
II,III,TALBOT,"I am indeed."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Then have I substance too."
II,III,TALBOT,"No, no, I am but shadow of myself:"
II,III,TALBOT,"You are deceived, my substance is not here;"
II,III,TALBOT,"For what you see is but the smallest part"
II,III,TALBOT,"And least proportion of humanity:"
II,III,TALBOT,"I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,"
II,III,TALBOT,"It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,"
II,III,TALBOT,"Your roof were not sufficient to contain't."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"He will be here, and yet he is not here:"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"How can these contrarieties agree?"
II,III,TALBOT,"That will I show you presently."
II,III,TALBOT,"How say you, madam? are you now persuaded"
II,III,TALBOT,"That Talbot is but shadow of himself?"
II,III,TALBOT,"These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,"
II,III,TALBOT,"With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,"
II,III,TALBOT,"Razeth your cities and subverts your towns"
II,III,TALBOT,"And in a moment makes them desolate."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"And more than may be gather'd by thy shape."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"For I am sorry that with reverence"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"I did not entertain thee as thou art."
II,III,TALBOT,"Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue"
II,III,TALBOT,"The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake"
II,III,TALBOT,"The outward composition of his body."
II,III,TALBOT,"What you have done hath not offended me;"
II,III,TALBOT,"Nor other satisfaction do I crave,"
II,III,TALBOT,"But only, with your patience, that we may"
II,III,TALBOT,"Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;"
II,III,TALBOT,"For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well."
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"With all my heart, and think me honoured"
II,III,COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE,"To feast so great a warrior in my house."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Dare no man answer in a case of truth?"
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;"
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"The garden here is more convenient."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?"
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"Faith, I have been a truant in the law,"
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"And never yet could frame my will to it;"
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"And therefore frame the law unto my will."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us."
II,IV,WARWICK,"Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Between two blades, which bears the better temper:"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Between two horses, which doth bear him best;"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;"
II,IV,WARWICK,"I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;"
II,IV,WARWICK,"But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"The truth appears so naked on my side"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"That any purblind eye may find it out."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"And on my side it is so well apparell'd,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"So clear, so shining and so evident"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Let him that is a true-born gentleman"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And stands upon the honour of his birth,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"From off this brier pluck a white rose with me."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"But dare maintain the party of the truth,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me."
II,IV,WARWICK,"I love no colours, and without all colour"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Of base insinuating flattery"
II,IV,WARWICK,"I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet."
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"I pluck this red rose with young Somerset"
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"And say withal I think he held the right."
II,IV,VERNON,"Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,"
II,IV,VERNON,"Till you conclude that he upon whose side"
II,IV,VERNON,"The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree"
II,IV,VERNON,"Shall yield the other in the right opinion."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And I."
II,IV,VERNON,"Then for the truth and plainness of the case."
II,IV,VERNON,"I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,"
II,IV,VERNON,"Giving my verdict on the white rose side."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"And fall on my side so, against your will."
II,IV,VERNON,"If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,"
II,IV,VERNON,"Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt"
II,IV,VERNON,"And keep me on the side where still I am."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Well, well, come on: who else?"
II,IV,Lawyer,"Unless my study and my books be false,"
II,IV,Lawyer,"The argument you held was wrong in you:"
II,IV,Lawyer,"In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Now, Somerset, where is your argument?"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Here in my scabbard, meditating that"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"For pale they look with fear, as witnessing"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"The truth on our side."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"No, Plantagenet,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"That shall maintain what I have said is true,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy."
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee."
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Away, away, good William de la Pole!"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"We grace the yeoman by conversing with him."
II,IV,WARWICK,"Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;"
II,IV,WARWICK,"His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Third son to the third Edward King of England:"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"He bears him on the place's privilege,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"By him that made me, I'll maintain my words"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"On any plot of ground in Christendom."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"For treason executed in our late king's days?"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"My father was attached, not attainted,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Were growing time once ripen'd to my will."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"For your partaker Pole and you yourself,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"I'll note you in my book of memory,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"To scourge you for this apprehension:"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Look to it well and say you are well warn'd."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"And know us by these colours for thy foes,"
II,IV,SOMERSET,"For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Will I for ever and my faction wear,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Until it wither with me to my grave"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Or flourish to the height of my degree."
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!"
II,IV,SUFFOLK,"And so farewell until I meet thee next."
II,IV,SOMERSET,"Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"How I am braved and must perforce endure it!"
II,IV,WARWICK,"This blot that they object against your house"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Shall be wiped out in the next parliament"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;"
II,IV,WARWICK,"And if thou be not then created York,"
II,IV,WARWICK,"I will not live to be accounted Warwick."
II,IV,WARWICK,"Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Against proud Somerset and William Pole,"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Will I upon thy party wear this rose:"
II,IV,WARWICK,"And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,"
II,IV,WARWICK,"Shall send between the red rose and the white"
II,IV,WARWICK,"A thousand souls to death and deadly night."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"That you on my behalf would pluck a flower."
II,IV,VERNON,"In your behalf still will I wear the same."
II,IV,Lawyer,"And so will I."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Thanks, gentle sir."
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say"
II,IV,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"This quarrel will drink blood another day."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Even like a man new haled from the rack,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"So fare my limbs with long imprisonment."
II,V,MORTIMER,"And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Nestor-like aged in an age of care,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."
II,V,MORTIMER,"These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine"
II,V,MORTIMER,"That droops his sapless branches to the ground;"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Unable to support this lump of clay,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"As witting I no other comfort have."
II,V,MORTIMER,"But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?"
II,V,First Gaoler,"Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:"
II,V,First Gaoler,"We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;"
II,V,First Gaoler,"And answer was return'd that he will come."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Before whose glory I was great in arms,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"This loathsome sequestration have I had:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And even since then hath Richard been obscured,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Deprived of honour and inheritance."
II,V,MORTIMER,"But now the arbitrator of despairs,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"I would his troubles likewise were expired,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"That so he might recover what was lost."
II,V,First Gaoler,"My lord, your loving nephew now is come."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"That I may kindly give one fainting kiss."
II,V,MORTIMER,"And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"This day, in argument upon a case,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Among which terms he used his lavish tongue"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And did upbraid me with my father's death:"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Else with the like I had requited him."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"In honour of a true Plantagenet"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And for alliance sake, declare the cause"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head."
II,V,MORTIMER,"That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Was cursed instrument of his decease."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Discover more at large what cause that was,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"For I am ignorant and cannot guess."
II,V,MORTIMER,"I will, if that my fading breath permit"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And death approach not ere my tale be done."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"The first-begotten and the lawful heir,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Of Edward king, the third of that descent:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"During whose reign the Percies of the north,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Finding his usurpation most unjust,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"The reason moved these warlike lords to this"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Leaving no heir begotten of his body--"
II,V,MORTIMER,"I was the next by birth and parentage;"
II,V,MORTIMER,"For by my mother I derived am"
II,V,MORTIMER,"From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son"
II,V,MORTIMER,"To King Edward the Third; whereas he"
II,V,MORTIMER,"From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Being but fourth of that heroic line."
II,V,MORTIMER,"But mark: as in this haughty attempt"
II,V,MORTIMER,"They laboured to plant the rightful heir,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"I lost my liberty and they their lives."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived"
II,V,MORTIMER,"From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Marrying my sister that thy mother was,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Again in pity of my hard distress"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Levied an army, weening to redeem"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And have install'd me in the diadem:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Of which, my lord, your honour is the last."
II,V,MORTIMER,"True; and thou seest that I no issue have"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And that my fainting words do warrant death;"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"But yet be wary in thy studious care."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"But yet, methinks, my father's execution"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Was nothing less than bloody tyranny."
II,V,MORTIMER,"With silence, nephew, be thou politic:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And like a mountain, not to be removed."
II,V,MORTIMER,"But now thy uncle is removing hence:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd"
II,V,MORTIMER,"With long continuance in a settled place."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"O, uncle, would some part of my young years"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Might but redeem the passage of your age!"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Which giveth many wounds when one will kill."
II,V,MORTIMER,"Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;"
II,V,MORTIMER,"Only give order for my funeral:"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes"
II,V,MORTIMER,"And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And like a hermit overpass'd thy days."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And what I do imagine let that rest."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Will see his burial better than his life."
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"I doubt not but with honour to redress;"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And therefore haste I to the parliament,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Either to be restored to my blood,"
II,V,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Or make my ill the advantage of my good."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"With written pamphlets studiously devised,"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Do it without invention, suddenly;"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"As I with sudden and extemporal speech"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Purpose to answer what thou canst object."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Think not, although in writing I preferr'd"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"That therefore I have forged, or am not able"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"As very infants prattle of thy pride."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Thou art a most pernicious usurer,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Forward by nature, enemy to peace;"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"A man of thy profession and degree;"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"As well at London bridge as at the Tower."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"From envious malice of thy swelling heart."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"To give me hearing what I shall reply."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"As he will have me, how am I so poor?"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Or how haps it I seek not to advance"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"And for dissension, who preferreth peace"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"More than I do?--except I be provoked."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"No, my good lords, it is not that offends;"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"It is not that that hath incensed the duke:"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"It is, because no one should sway but he;"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"No one but he should be about the king;"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"And that engenders thunder in his breast"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"And makes him roar these accusations forth."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"But he shall know I am as good--"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"As good!"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Thou bastard of my grandfather!"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"But one imperious in another's throne?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Am I not protector, saucy priest?"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"And am not I a prelate of the church?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"And useth it to patronage his theft."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Unreverent Gloster!"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Thou art reverent"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Rome shall remedy this."
III,I,WARWICK,"Roam thither, then."
III,I,SOMERSET,"My lord, it were your duty to forbear."
III,I,WARWICK,"Ay, see the bishop be not overborne."
III,I,SOMERSET,"Methinks my lord should be religious"
III,I,SOMERSET,"And know the office that belongs to such."
III,I,WARWICK,"Methinks his lordship should be humbler;"
III,I,WARWICK,"it fitteth not a prelate so to plead."
III,I,SOMERSET,"Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near."
III,I,WARWICK,"State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?"
III,I,WARWICK,"Is not his grace protector to the king?"
III,I,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;"
III,I,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'"
III,I,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Else would I have a fling at Winchester."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"The special watchmen of our English weal,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"To join your hearts in love and amity."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"O, what a scandal is it to our crown,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"That two such noble peers as ye should jar!"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Civil dissension is a viperous worm"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"What tumult's this?"
III,I,WARWICK,"An uproar, I dare warrant,"
III,I,WARWICK,"Begun through malice of the bishop's men."
III,I,Mayor,"O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,"
III,I,Mayor,"Pity the city of London, pity us!"
III,I,Mayor,"The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,"
III,I,Mayor,"Forbidden late to carry any weapon,"
III,I,Mayor,"Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones"
III,I,Mayor,"And banding themselves in contrary parts"
III,I,Mayor,"Do pelt so fast at one another's pate"
III,I,Mayor,"That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:"
III,I,Mayor,"Our windows are broke down in every street"
III,I,Mayor,"And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife."
III,I,First Serving-man,"Nay, if we be forbidden stones,"
III,I,First Serving-man,"We'll fall to it with our teeth."
III,I,Second Serving-man,"Do what ye dare, we are as resolute."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"You of my household, leave this peevish broil"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"And set this unaccustom'd fight aside."
III,I,Third Serving-man,"My lord, we know your grace to be a man"
III,I,Third Serving-man,"Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,"
III,I,Third Serving-man,"Inferior to none but to his majesty:"
III,I,Third Serving-man,"And ere that we will suffer such a prince,"
III,I,Third Serving-man,"So kind a father of the commonweal,"
III,I,Third Serving-man,"To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,"
III,I,Third Serving-man,"We and our wives and children all will fight"
III,I,Third Serving-man,"And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes."
III,I,First Serving-man,"Ay, and the very parings of our nails"
III,I,First Serving-man,"Shall pitch a field when we are dead."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Stay, stay, I say!"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"And if you love me, as you say you do,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Let me persuade you to forbear awhile."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"My sighs and tears and will not once relent?"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Who should be pitiful, if you be not?"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Or who should study to prefer a peace."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"If holy churchmen take delight in broils?"
III,I,WARWICK,"Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;"
III,I,WARWICK,"Except you mean with obstinate repulse"
III,I,WARWICK,"To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm."
III,I,WARWICK,"You see what mischief and what murder too"
III,I,WARWICK,"Hath been enacted through your enmity;"
III,I,WARWICK,"Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"He shall submit, or I will never yield."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Compassion on the king commands me stoop;"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Should ever get that privilege of me."
III,I,WARWICK,"Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke"
III,I,WARWICK,"Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,"
III,I,WARWICK,"As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:"
III,I,WARWICK,"Why look you still so stern and tragical?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"That malice was a great and grievous sin;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And will not you maintain the thing you teach,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"But prove a chief offender in the same?"
III,I,WARWICK,"Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird."
III,I,WARWICK,"For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!"
III,I,WARWICK,"What, shall a child instruct you what to do?"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;"
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"Love for thy love and hand for hand I give."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"See here, my friends and loving countrymen,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"This token serveth for a flag of truce"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"So help me God, as I dissemble not!"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"How joyful am I made by this contract!"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Away, my masters! trouble us no more;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"But join in friendship, as your lords have done."
III,I,First Serving-man,"Content: I'll to the surgeon's."
III,I,Second Serving-man,"And so will I."
III,I,Third Serving-man,"And I will see what physic the tavern affords."
III,I,WARWICK,"Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,"
III,I,WARWICK,"Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet"
III,I,WARWICK,"We do exhibit to your majesty."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"And if your grace mark every circumstance,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"You have great reason to do Richard right;"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Especially for those occasions"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"At Eltham Place I told your majesty."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And those occasions, uncle, were of force:"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"That Richard be restored to his blood."
III,I,WARWICK,"Let Richard be restored to his blood;"
III,I,WARWICK,"So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed."
III,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"As will the rest, so willeth Winchester."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"If Richard will be true, not that alone"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"But all the whole inheritance I give"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"That doth belong unto the house of York,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"From whence you spring by lineal descent."
III,I,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"Thy humble servant vows obedience"
III,I,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And humble service till the point of death."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And, in reguerdon of that duty done,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And rise created princely Duke of York."
III,I,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!"
III,I,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"And as my duty springs, so perish they"
III,I,RICHARD PLANTAGENET,"That grudge one thought against your majesty!"
III,I,ALL,"Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Now will it best avail your majesty"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"The presence of a king engenders love"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"As it disanimates his enemies."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"For friendly counsel cuts off many foes."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Your ships already are in readiness."
III,I,EXETER,"Ay, we may march in England or in France,"
III,I,EXETER,"Not seeing what is likely to ensue."
III,I,EXETER,"This late dissension grown betwixt the peers"
III,I,EXETER,"Burns under feigned ashes of forged love"
III,I,EXETER,"And will at last break out into a flame:"
III,I,EXETER,"As fester'd members rot but by degree,"
III,I,EXETER,"Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,"
III,I,EXETER,"So will this base and envious discord breed."
III,I,EXETER,"And now I fear that fatal prophecy"
III,I,EXETER,"Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth"
III,I,EXETER,"Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;"
III,I,EXETER,"That Henry born at Monmouth should win all"
III,I,EXETER,"And Henry born at Windsor lose all:"
III,I,EXETER,"Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish"
III,I,EXETER,"His days may finish ere that hapless time."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Through which our policy must make a breach:"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Take heed, be wary how you place your words;"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Talk like the vulgar sort of market men"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That come to gather money for their corn."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And that we find the slothful watch but weak,"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them."
III,II,First Soldier,"Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,"
III,II,First Soldier,"And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;"
III,II,First Soldier,"Therefore we'll knock."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Paysans, pauvres gens de France;"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Poor market folks that come to sell their corn."
III,II,Watch,"Enter, go in; the market bell is rung."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground."
III,II,CHARLES,"Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!"
III,II,CHARLES,"And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen."
III,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;"
III,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Now she is there, how will she specify"
III,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Where is the best and safest passage in?"
III,II,REIGNIER,"By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;"
III,II,REIGNIER,"Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,"
III,II,REIGNIER,"No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Behold, this is the happy wedding torch"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But burning fatal to the Talbotites!"
III,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;"
III,II,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"The burning torch in yonder turret stands."
III,II,CHARLES,"Now shine it like a comet of revenge,"
III,II,CHARLES,"A prophet to the fall of all our foes!"
III,II,REIGNIER,"Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;"
III,II,REIGNIER,"Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,"
III,II,REIGNIER,"And then do execution on the watch."
III,II,TALBOT,"France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,"
III,II,TALBOT,"If Talbot but survive thy treachery."
III,II,TALBOT,"Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,"
III,II,TALBOT,"Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,"
III,II,TALBOT,"That hardly we escaped the pride of France."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Before he'll buy again at such a rate:"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"'Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?"
III,II,BURGUNDY,"Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!"
III,II,BURGUNDY,"I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own"
III,II,BURGUNDY,"And make thee curse the harvest of that corn."
III,II,CHARLES,"Your grace may starve perhaps before that time."
III,II,BEDFORD,"O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And run a tilt at death within a chair?"
III,II,TALBOT,"Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,"
III,II,TALBOT,"Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!"
III,II,TALBOT,"Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age"
III,II,TALBOT,"And twit with cowardice a man half dead?"
III,II,TALBOT,"Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,"
III,II,TALBOT,"Or else let Talbot perish with this shame."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?"
III,II,TALBOT,"Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To try if that our own be ours or no."
III,II,TALBOT,"I speak not to that railing Hecate,"
III,II,TALBOT,"But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest;"
III,II,TALBOT,"Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?"
III,II,ALENCON,"Signior, no."
III,II,TALBOT,"Signior, hang! base muleters of France!"
III,II,TALBOT,"Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls"
III,II,TALBOT,"And dare not take up arms like gentlemen."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"For Talbot means no goodness by his looks."
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you"
III,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That we are here."
III,II,TALBOT,"And there will we be too, ere it be long,"
III,II,TALBOT,"Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!"
III,II,TALBOT,"Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,"
III,II,TALBOT,"Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,"
III,II,TALBOT,"Either to get the town again or die:"
III,II,TALBOT,"And I, as sure as English Henry lives"
III,II,TALBOT,"And as his father here was conqueror,"
III,II,TALBOT,"As sure as in this late-betrayed town"
III,II,TALBOT,"Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,"
III,II,TALBOT,"So sure I swear to get the town or die."
III,II,BURGUNDY,"My vows are equal partners with thy vows."
III,II,TALBOT,"But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,"
III,II,TALBOT,"The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,"
III,II,TALBOT,"We will bestow you in some better place,"
III,II,TALBOT,"Fitter for sickness and for crazy age."
III,II,BEDFORD,"Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:"
III,II,BEDFORD,"Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen"
III,II,BEDFORD,"And will be partner of your weal or woe."
III,II,BURGUNDY,"Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you."
III,II,BEDFORD,"Not to be gone from hence; for once I read"
III,II,BEDFORD,"That stout Pendragon in his litter sick"
III,II,BEDFORD,"Came to the field and vanquished his foes:"
III,II,BEDFORD,"Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,"
III,II,BEDFORD,"Because I ever found them as myself."
III,II,TALBOT,"Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!"
III,II,TALBOT,"Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!"
III,II,TALBOT,"And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,"
III,II,TALBOT,"But gather we our forces out of hand"
III,II,TALBOT,"And set upon our boasting enemy."
III,II,Captain,"Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?"
III,II,FASTOLFE,"Whither away! to save myself by flight:"
III,II,FASTOLFE,"We are like to have the overthrow again."
III,II,Captain,"What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?"
III,II,FASTOLFE,"Ay,"
III,II,FASTOLFE,"All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!"
III,II,Captain,"Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!"
III,II,BEDFORD,"Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,"
III,II,BEDFORD,"For I have seen our enemies' overthrow."
III,II,BEDFORD,"What is the trust or strength of foolish man?"
III,II,BEDFORD,"They that of late were daring with their scoffs"
III,II,BEDFORD,"Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves."
III,II,TALBOT,"Lost, and recover'd in a day again!"
III,II,TALBOT,"This is a double honour, Burgundy:"
III,II,TALBOT,"Yet heavens have glory for this victory!"
III,II,BURGUNDY,"Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy"
III,II,BURGUNDY,"Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects"
III,II,BURGUNDY,"Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments."
III,II,TALBOT,"Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?"
III,II,TALBOT,"I think her old familiar is asleep:"
III,II,TALBOT,"Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?"
III,II,TALBOT,"What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief"
III,II,TALBOT,"That such a valiant company are fled."
III,II,TALBOT,"Now will we take some order in the town,"
III,II,TALBOT,"Placing therein some expert officers,"
III,II,TALBOT,"And then depart to Paris to the king,"
III,II,TALBOT,"For there young Henry with his nobles lie."
III,II,BURGUNDY,"What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy."
III,II,TALBOT,"But yet, before we go, let's not forget"
III,II,TALBOT,"The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,"
III,II,TALBOT,"But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:"
III,II,TALBOT,"A braver soldier never couched lance,"
III,II,TALBOT,"A gentler heart did never sway in court;"
III,II,TALBOT,"But kings and mightiest potentates must die,"
III,II,TALBOT,"For that's the end of human misery."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Dismay not, princes, at this accident,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"For things that are not to be remedied."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And like a peacock sweep along his tail;"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled."
III,III,CHARLES,"We have been guided by thee hitherto,"
III,III,CHARLES,"And of thy cunning had no diffidence:"
III,III,CHARLES,"One sudden foil shall never breed distrust."
III,III,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Search out thy wit for secret policies,"
III,III,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"And we will make thee famous through the world."
III,III,ALENCON,"We'll set thy statue in some holy place,"
III,III,ALENCON,"And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:"
III,III,ALENCON,"Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"We will entice the Duke of Burgundy"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To leave the Talbot and to follow us."
III,III,CHARLES,"Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,"
III,III,CHARLES,"France were no place for Henry's warriors;"
III,III,CHARLES,"Nor should that nation boast it so with us,"
III,III,CHARLES,"But be extirped from our provinces."
III,III,ALENCON,"For ever should they be expulsed from France"
III,III,ALENCON,"And not have title of an earldom here."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Your honours shall perceive how I will work"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To bring this matter to the wished end."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And all the troops of English after him."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Fortune in favour makes him lag behind."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Summon a parley; we will talk with him."
III,III,CHARLES,"A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!"
III,III,BURGUNDY,"Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"The princely Charles of France, thy countryman."
III,III,BURGUNDY,"What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence."
III,III,CHARLES,"Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee."
III,III,BURGUNDY,"Speak on; but be not over-tedious."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Look on thy country, look on fertile France,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And see the cities and the towns defaced"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"By wasting ruin of the cruel foe."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"As looks the mother on her lowly babe"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"When death doth close his tender dying eyes,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"See, see the pining malady of France;"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O, turn thy edged sword another way;"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And wash away thy country's stained spots."
III,III,BURGUNDY,"Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,"
III,III,BURGUNDY,"Or nature makes me suddenly relent."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"When Talbot hath set footing once in France"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Who then but English Henry will be lord"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And was he not in England prisoner?"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But when they heard he was thine enemy,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"They set him free without his ransom paid,"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"In spite of Burgundy and all his friends."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen."
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:"
III,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms."
III,III,BURGUNDY,"I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers"
III,III,BURGUNDY,"Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,"
III,III,BURGUNDY,"And made me almost yield upon my knees."
III,III,BURGUNDY,"Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,"
III,III,BURGUNDY,"And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:"
III,III,BURGUNDY,"My forces and my power of men are yours:"
III,III,BURGUNDY,"So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee."
III,III,CHARLES,"Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh."
III,III,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"And doth beget new courage in our breasts."
III,III,ALENCON,"Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,"
III,III,ALENCON,"And doth deserve a coronet of gold."
III,III,CHARLES,"Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,"
III,III,CHARLES,"And seek how we may prejudice the foe."
III,IV,TALBOT,"My gracious prince, and honourable peers,"
III,IV,TALBOT,"Hearing of your arrival in this realm,"
III,IV,TALBOT,"I have awhile given truce unto my wars,"
III,IV,TALBOT,"To do my duty to my sovereign:"
III,IV,TALBOT,"In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd"
III,IV,TALBOT,"To your obedience fifty fortresses,"
III,IV,TALBOT,"Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,"
III,IV,TALBOT,"Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,"
III,IV,TALBOT,"Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,"
III,IV,TALBOT,"And with submissive loyalty of heart"
III,IV,TALBOT,"Ascribes the glory of his conquest got"
III,IV,TALBOT,"First to my God and next unto your grace."
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"That hath so long been resident in France?"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege."
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"When I was young, as yet I am not old,"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"I do remember how my father said"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"A stouter champion never handled sword."
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"Long since we were resolved of your truth,"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"Your faithful service and your toil in war;"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"Yet never have you tasted our reward,"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"Because till now we never saw your face:"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;"
III,IV,KING HENRY VI,"And in our coronation take your place."
III,IV,VERNON,"Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,"
III,IV,VERNON,"Disgracing of these colours that I wear"
III,IV,VERNON,"In honour of my noble Lord of York:"
III,IV,VERNON,"Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?"
III,IV,BASSET,"Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage"
III,IV,BASSET,"The envious barking of your saucy tongue"
III,IV,BASSET,"Against my lord the Duke of Somerset."
III,IV,VERNON,"Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is."
III,IV,BASSET,"Why, what is he? as good a man as York."
III,IV,VERNON,"Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that."
III,IV,BASSET,"Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such"
III,IV,BASSET,"That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,"
III,IV,BASSET,"Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood."
III,IV,BASSET,"But I'll unto his majesty, and crave"
III,IV,BASSET,"I may have liberty to venge this wrong;"
III,IV,BASSET,"When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost."
III,IV,VERNON,"Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;"
III,IV,VERNON,"And, after, meet you sooner than you would."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head."
IV,I,BISHOP OF WINCHESTER,"God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"That you elect no other king but him;"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And none your foes but such as shall pretend"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Malicious practises against his state:"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!"
IV,I,FASTOLFE,"My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,"
IV,I,FASTOLFE,"To haste unto your coronation,"
IV,I,FASTOLFE,"A letter was deliver'd to my hands,"
IV,I,FASTOLFE,"Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy."
IV,I,TALBOT,"Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!"
IV,I,TALBOT,"I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Which I have done, because unworthily"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Thou wast installed in that high degree."
IV,I,TALBOT,"Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest"
IV,I,TALBOT,"This dastard, at the battle of Patay,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"When but in all I was six thousand strong"
IV,I,TALBOT,"And that the French were almost ten to one,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Before we met or that a stroke was given,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Like to a trusty squire did run away:"
IV,I,TALBOT,"In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Myself and divers gentlemen beside"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Were there surprised and taken prisoners."
IV,I,TALBOT,"Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Or whether that such cowards ought to wear"
IV,I,TALBOT,"This ornament of knighthood, yea or no."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"To say the truth, this fact was infamous"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And ill beseeming any common man,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Much more a knight, a captain and a leader."
IV,I,TALBOT,"When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Knights of the garter were of noble birth,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Such as were grown to credit by the wars;"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"But always resolute in most extremes."
IV,I,TALBOT,"He then that is not furnish'd in this sort"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Profaning this most honourable order,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"And should, if I were worthy to be judge,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain"
IV,I,TALBOT,"That doth presume to boast of gentle blood."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And now, my lord protector, view the letter"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Or doth this churlish superscription"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Pretend some alteration in good will?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"What's here?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"'I have, upon especial cause,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Together with the pitiful complaints"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Of such as your oppression feeds upon,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Forsaken your pernicious faction"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"O monstrous treachery! can this be so,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"That in alliance, amity and oaths,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"There should be found such false dissembling guile?"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"He doth, my lord, and is become your foe."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Is that the worst this letter doth contain?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And give him chastisement for this abuse."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"How say you, my lord? are you not content?"
IV,I,TALBOT,"Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,"
IV,I,TALBOT,"I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Then gather strength and march unto him straight:"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And what offence it is to flout his friends."
IV,I,TALBOT,"I go, my lord, in heart desiring still"
IV,I,TALBOT,"You may behold confusion of your foes."
IV,I,VERNON,"Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign."
IV,I,BASSET,"And me, my lord, grant me the combat too."
IV,I,YORK,"This is my servant: hear him, noble prince."
IV,I,SOMERSET,"And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?"
IV,I,VERNON,"With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong."
IV,I,BASSET,"And I with him; for he hath done me wrong."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"What is that wrong whereof you both complain?"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"First let me know, and then I'll answer you."
IV,I,BASSET,"Crossing the sea from England into France,"
IV,I,BASSET,"This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,"
IV,I,BASSET,"Upbraided me about the rose I wear;"
IV,I,BASSET,"Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves"
IV,I,BASSET,"Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,"
IV,I,BASSET,"When stubbornly he did repugn the truth"
IV,I,BASSET,"About a certain question in the law"
IV,I,BASSET,"Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;"
IV,I,BASSET,"With other vile and ignominious terms:"
IV,I,BASSET,"In confutation of which rude reproach"
IV,I,BASSET,"And in defence of my lord's worthiness,"
IV,I,BASSET,"I crave the benefit of law of arms."
IV,I,VERNON,"And that is my petition, noble lord:"
IV,I,VERNON,"For though he seem with forged quaint conceit"
IV,I,VERNON,"To set a gloss upon his bold intent,"
IV,I,VERNON,"Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;"
IV,I,VERNON,"And he first took exceptions at this badge,"
IV,I,VERNON,"Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower"
IV,I,VERNON,"Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart."
IV,I,YORK,"Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?"
IV,I,SOMERSET,"Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,"
IV,I,SOMERSET,"Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"When for so slight and frivolous a cause"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Such factious emulations shall arise!"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace."
IV,I,YORK,"Let this dissension first be tried by fight,"
IV,I,YORK,"And then your highness shall command a peace."
IV,I,SOMERSET,"The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;"
IV,I,SOMERSET,"Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then."
IV,I,YORK,"There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset."
IV,I,VERNON,"Nay, let it rest where it began at first."
IV,I,BASSET,"Confirm it so, mine honourable lord."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And perish ye, with your audacious prate!"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"With this immodest clamorous outrage"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"To trouble and disturb the king and us?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And you, my lords, methinks you do not well"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"To bear with their perverse objections;"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Much less to take occasion from their mouths"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Let me persuade you take a better course."
IV,I,EXETER,"It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Come hither, you that would be combatants:"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And you, my lords, remember where we are,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"If they perceive dissension in our looks"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And that within ourselves we disagree,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"How will their grudging stomachs be provoked"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"To wilful disobedience, and rebel!"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Beside, what infamy will there arise,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"When foreign princes shall be certified"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"That for a toy, a thing of no regard,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"King Henry's peers and chief nobility"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"O, think upon the conquest of my father,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"My tender years, and let us not forego"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"That for a trifle that was bought with blood"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"I see no reason, if I wear this rose,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"That any one should therefore be suspicious"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"I more incline to Somerset than York:"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"As well they may upbraid me with my crown,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"But your discretions better can persuade"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Than I am able to instruct or teach:"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And therefore, as we hither came in peace,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"So let us still continue peace and love."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Cousin of York, we institute your grace"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"To be our regent in these parts of France:"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Go cheerfully together and digest."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Your angry choler on your enemies."
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"Ourself, my lord protector and the rest"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"After some respite will return to Calais;"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"From thence to England; where I hope ere long"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"To be presented, by your victories,"
IV,I,KING HENRY VI,"With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout."
IV,I,WARWICK,"My Lord of York, I promise you, the king"
IV,I,WARWICK,"Prettily, methought, did play the orator."
IV,I,YORK,"And so he did; but yet I like it not,"
IV,I,YORK,"In that he wears the badge of Somerset."
IV,I,WARWICK,"Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;"
IV,I,WARWICK,"I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm."
IV,I,YORK,"An if I wist he did,--but let it rest;"
IV,I,YORK,"Other affairs must now be managed."
IV,I,EXETER,"Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;"
IV,I,EXETER,"For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,"
IV,I,EXETER,"I fear we should have seen decipher'd there"
IV,I,EXETER,"More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,"
IV,I,EXETER,"Than yet can be imagined or supposed."
IV,I,EXETER,"But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees"
IV,I,EXETER,"This jarring discord of nobility,"
IV,I,EXETER,"This shouldering of each other in the court,"
IV,I,EXETER,"This factious bandying of their favourites,"
IV,I,EXETER,"But that it doth presage some ill event."
IV,I,EXETER,"'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;"
IV,I,EXETER,"But more when envy breeds unkind division;"
IV,I,EXETER,"There comes the rain, there begins confusion."
IV,II,TALBOT,"Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter:"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Summon their general unto the wall."
IV,II,TALBOT,"English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Servant in arms to Harry King of England;"
IV,II,TALBOT,"And thus he would: Open your city gates;"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"And do him homage as obedient subjects;"
IV,II,TALBOT,"And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:"
IV,II,TALBOT,"But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"You tempt the fury of my three attendants,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Who in a moment even with the earth"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"If you forsake the offer of their love."
IV,II,General,"Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,"
IV,II,General,"Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!"
IV,II,General,"The period of thy tyranny approacheth."
IV,II,General,"On us thou canst not enter but by death;"
IV,II,General,"For, I protest, we are well fortified"
IV,II,General,"And strong enough to issue out and fight:"
IV,II,General,"If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,"
IV,II,General,"Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:"
IV,II,General,"On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,"
IV,II,General,"To wall thee from the liberty of flight;"
IV,II,General,"And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,"
IV,II,General,"But death doth front thee with apparent spoil"
IV,II,General,"And pale destruction meets thee in the face."
IV,II,General,"Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament"
IV,II,General,"To rive their dangerous artillery"
IV,II,General,"Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot."
IV,II,General,"Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,"
IV,II,General,"Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!"
IV,II,General,"This is the latest glory of thy praise"
IV,II,General,"That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;"
IV,II,General,"For ere the glass, that now begins to run,"
IV,II,General,"Finish the process of his sandy hour,"
IV,II,General,"These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,"
IV,II,General,"Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead."
IV,II,General,"Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,"
IV,II,General,"Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;"
IV,II,General,"And mine shall ring thy dire departure out."
IV,II,TALBOT,"He fables not; I hear the enemy:"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings."
IV,II,TALBOT,"O, negligent and heedless discipline!"
IV,II,TALBOT,"How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"A little herd of England's timorous deer,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!"
IV,II,TALBOT,"If we be English deer, be then in blood;"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel"
IV,II,TALBOT,"And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Sell every man his life as dear as mine,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends."
IV,II,TALBOT,"God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,"
IV,II,TALBOT,"Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!"
IV,III,YORK,"Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,"
IV,III,YORK,"That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?"
IV,III,Messenger,"They are return'd, my lord, and give it out"
IV,III,Messenger,"That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,"
IV,III,Messenger,"To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,"
IV,III,Messenger,"By your espials were discovered"
IV,III,Messenger,"Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,"
IV,III,Messenger,"Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux."
IV,III,YORK,"A plague upon that villain Somerset,"
IV,III,YORK,"That thus delays my promised supply"
IV,III,YORK,"Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!"
IV,III,YORK,"Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,"
IV,III,YORK,"And I am lowted by a traitor villain"
IV,III,YORK,"And cannot help the noble chevalier:"
IV,III,YORK,"God comfort him in this necessity!"
IV,III,YORK,"If he miscarry, farewell wars in France."
IV,III,LUCY,"Thou princely leader of our English strength,"
IV,III,LUCY,"Never so needful on the earth of France,"
IV,III,LUCY,"Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,"
IV,III,LUCY,"Who now is girdled with a waist of iron"
IV,III,LUCY,"And hemm'd about with grim destruction:"
IV,III,LUCY,"To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!"
IV,III,LUCY,"Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour."
IV,III,YORK,"O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart"
IV,III,YORK,"Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!"
IV,III,YORK,"So should we save a valiant gentleman"
IV,III,YORK,"By forfeiting a traitor and a coward."
IV,III,YORK,"Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,"
IV,III,YORK,"That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep."
IV,III,LUCY,"O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!"
IV,III,YORK,"He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;"
IV,III,YORK,"We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;"
IV,III,YORK,"All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset."
IV,III,LUCY,"Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;"
IV,III,LUCY,"And on his son young John, who two hours since"
IV,III,LUCY,"I met in travel toward his warlike father!"
IV,III,LUCY,"This seven years did not Talbot see his son;"
IV,III,LUCY,"And now they meet where both their lives are done."
IV,III,YORK,"Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have"
IV,III,YORK,"To bid his young son welcome to his grave?"
IV,III,YORK,"Away! vexation almost stops my breath,"
IV,III,YORK,"That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death."
IV,III,YORK,"Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,"
IV,III,YORK,"But curse the cause I cannot aid the man."
IV,III,YORK,"Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,"
IV,III,YORK,"'Long all of Somerset and his delay."
IV,III,LUCY,"Thus, while the vulture of sedition"
IV,III,LUCY,"Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,"
IV,III,LUCY,"Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss"
IV,III,LUCY,"The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,"
IV,III,LUCY,"That ever living man of memory,"
IV,III,LUCY,"Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,"
IV,III,LUCY,"Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss."
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"It is too late; I cannot send them now:"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"This expedition was by York and Talbot"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"Too rashly plotted: all our general force"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"Might with a sally of the very town"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"York set him on to fight and die in shame,"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name."
IV,IV,Captain,"Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me"
IV,IV,Captain,"Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid."
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Cries out for noble York and Somerset,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"To beat assailing death from his weak legions:"
IV,IV,LUCY,"And whiles the honourable captain there"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Keep off aloof with worthless emulation."
IV,IV,LUCY,"Let not your private discord keep away"
IV,IV,LUCY,"The levied succors that should lend him aid,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"While he, renowned noble gentleman,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Yields up his life unto a world of odds:"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"And Talbot perisheth by your default."
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"York set him on; York should have sent him aid."
IV,IV,LUCY,"And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Swearing that you withhold his levied host,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Collected for this expedition."
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"I owe him little duty, and less love;"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending."
IV,IV,LUCY,"The fraud of England, not the force of France,"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:"
IV,IV,LUCY,"Never to England shall he bear his life;"
IV,IV,LUCY,"But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife."
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:"
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"Within six hours they will be at his aid."
IV,IV,LUCY,"Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain;"
IV,IV,LUCY,"For fly he could not, if he would have fled;"
IV,IV,LUCY,"And fly would Talbot never, though he might."
IV,IV,SOMERSET,"If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!"
IV,IV,LUCY,"His fame lives in the world, his shame in you."
IV,V,TALBOT,"O young John Talbot! I did send for thee"
IV,V,TALBOT,"To tutor thee in stratagems of war,"
IV,V,TALBOT,"That Talbot's name might be in thee revived"
IV,V,TALBOT,"When sapless age and weak unable limbs"
IV,V,TALBOT,"Should bring thy father to his drooping chair."
IV,V,TALBOT,"But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!"
IV,V,TALBOT,"Now thou art come unto a feast of death,"
IV,V,TALBOT,"A terrible and unavoided danger:"
IV,V,TALBOT,"Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;"
IV,V,TALBOT,"And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape"
IV,V,TALBOT,"By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Dishonour not her honourable name,"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"To make a bastard and a slave of me!"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"That basely fled when noble Talbot stood."
IV,V,TALBOT,"Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"He that flies so will ne'er return again."
IV,V,TALBOT,"If we both stay, we both are sure to die."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Your loss is great, so your regard should be;"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"My worth unknown, no loss is known in me."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Upon my death the French can little boast;"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"But mine it will, that no exploit have done:"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"There is no hope that ever I will stay,"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"If the first hour I shrink and run away."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Here on my knee I beg mortality,"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Rather than life preserved with infamy."
IV,V,TALBOT,"Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb."
IV,V,TALBOT,"Upon my blessing, I command thee go."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"To fight I will, but not to fly the foe."
IV,V,TALBOT,"Part of thy father may be saved in thee."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"No part of him but will be shame in me."
IV,V,TALBOT,"Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?"
IV,V,TALBOT,"Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"You cannot witness for me, being slain."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"If death be so apparent, then both fly."
IV,V,TALBOT,"And leave my followers here to fight and die?"
IV,V,TALBOT,"My age was never tainted with such shame."
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"No more can I be sever'd from your side,"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;"
IV,V,JOHN TALBOT,"For live I will not, if my father die."
IV,V,TALBOT,"Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,"
IV,V,TALBOT,"Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon."
IV,V,TALBOT,"Come, side by side together live and die."
IV,V,TALBOT,"And soul with soul from France to heaven fly."
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight."
IV,VI,TALBOT,"The regent hath with Talbot broke his word"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"And left us to the rage of France his sword."
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"I gave thee life and rescued thee from death."
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"To my determined time thou gavest new date."
IV,VI,TALBOT,"When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee."
IV,VI,TALBOT,"The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"And interchanging blows I quickly shed"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"The help of one stands me in little stead."
IV,VI,TALBOT,"O, too much folly is it, well I wot,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"To hazard all our lives in one small boat!"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"By me they nothing gain an if I stay;"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"All these and more we hazard by thy stay;"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"All these are saved if thou wilt fly away."
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"On that advantage, bought with such a shame,"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"The coward horse that bears me fail and die!"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"And like me to the peasant boys of France,"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"Surely, by all the glory you have won,"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;"
IV,VI,JOHN TALBOT,"If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot."
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;"
IV,VI,TALBOT,"And, commendable proved, let's die in pride."
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Where is my other life? mine own is gone;"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"And, like a hungry lion, did commence"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"But when my angry guardant stood alone,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Suddenly made him from my side to start"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Into the clustering battle of the French;"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"And in that sea of blood my boy did drench"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"His over-mounting spirit, and there died,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride."
IV,VII,Servant,"O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"In thy despite shall 'scape mortality."
IV,VII,TALBOT,"O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe."
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Had death been French, then death had died to-day."
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"My spirit can no longer bear these harms."
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,"
IV,VII,TALBOT,"Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave."
IV,VII,CHARLES,"Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,"
IV,VII,CHARLES,"We should have found a bloody day of this."
IV,VII,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,"
IV,VII,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But, with a proud majestical high scorn,"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"So, rushing in the bowels of the French,"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"He left me proudly, as unworthy fight."
IV,VII,BURGUNDY,"Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;"
IV,VII,BURGUNDY,"See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms"
IV,VII,BURGUNDY,"Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!"
IV,VII,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder"
IV,VII,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder."
IV,VII,CHARLES,"O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled"
IV,VII,CHARLES,"During the life, let us not wrong it dead."
IV,VII,LUCY,"Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"To know who hath obtained the glory of the day."
IV,VII,CHARLES,"On what submissive message art thou sent?"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Submission, Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word;"
IV,VII,LUCY,"We English warriors wot not what it means."
IV,VII,LUCY,"I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en"
IV,VII,LUCY,"And to survey the bodies of the dead."
IV,VII,CHARLES,"For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is."
IV,VII,CHARLES,"But tell me whom thou seek'st."
IV,VII,LUCY,"But where's the great Alcides of the field,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Created, for his rare success in arms,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence;"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge;"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Knight of the noble order of Saint George,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece;"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Great marshal to Henry the Sixth"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Of all his wars within the realm of France?"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Here is a silly stately style indeed!"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Writes not so tedious a style as this."
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet."
IV,VII,LUCY,"Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?"
IV,VII,LUCY,"O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!"
IV,VII,LUCY,"O, that I could but call these dead to life!"
IV,VII,LUCY,"It were enough to fright the realm of France:"
IV,VII,LUCY,"Were but his picture left amongst you here,"
IV,VII,LUCY,"It would amaze the proudest of you all."
IV,VII,LUCY,"Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence"
IV,VII,LUCY,"And give them burial as beseems their worth."
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit."
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,"
IV,VII,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"They would but stink, and putrefy the air."
IV,VII,CHARLES,"Go, take their bodies hence."
IV,VII,LUCY,"I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd"
IV,VII,LUCY,"A phoenix that shall make all France afeard."
IV,VII,CHARLES,"So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt."
IV,VII,CHARLES,"And now to Paris, in this conquering vein:"
IV,VII,CHARLES,"All will be ours, now bloody Talbot's slain."
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Have you perused the letters from the pope,"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"The emperor and the Earl of Armagnac?"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"I have, my lord: and their intent is this:"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"They humbly sue unto your excellence"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"To have a godly peace concluded of"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Between the realms of England and of France."
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"How doth your grace affect their motion?"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Well, my good lord; and as the only means"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"To stop effusion of our Christian blood"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"And 'stablish quietness on every side."
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"It was both impious and unnatural"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"That such immanity and bloody strife"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Should reign among professors of one faith."
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"And surer bind this knot of amity,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"A man of great authority in France,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Proffers his only daughter to your grace"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry."
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"And fitter is my study and my books"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Than wanton dalliance with a paramour."
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Yet call the ambassador; and, as you please,"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"So let them have their answers every one:"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"I shall be well content with any choice"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Tends to God's glory and my country's weal."
V,I,EXETER,"What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd,"
V,I,EXETER,"And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?"
V,I,EXETER,"Then I perceive that will be verified"
V,I,EXETER,"Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy,"
V,I,EXETER,"'If once he come to be a cardinal,"
V,I,EXETER,"He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.'"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"My lords ambassadors, your several suits"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Have been consider'd and debated on."
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"And therefore are we certainly resolved"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"To draw conditions of a friendly peace;"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Shall be transported presently to France."
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"And for the proffer of my lord your master,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"I have inform'd his highness so at large"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Her beauty and the value of her dower,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"He doth intend she shall be England's queen."
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"In argument and proof of which contract,"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection."
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"And so, my lord protector, see them guarded"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd"
V,I,KING HENRY VI,"Commit them to the fortune of the sea."
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive"
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"The sum of money which I promised"
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Should be deliver'd to his holiness"
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"For clothing me in these grave ornaments."
V,I,Legate,"I will attend upon your lordship's leisure."
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Or be inferior to the proudest peer."
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive"
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"That, neither in birth or for authority,"
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"The bishop will be overborne by thee:"
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,"
V,I,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Or sack this country with a mutiny."
V,II,CHARLES,"These news, my lord, may cheer our drooping spirits:"
V,II,CHARLES,"'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt"
V,II,CHARLES,"And turn again unto the warlike French."
V,II,ALENCON,"Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,"
V,II,ALENCON,"And keep not back your powers in dalliance."
V,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us;"
V,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Else, ruin combat with their palaces!"
V,II,Scout,"Success unto our valiant general,"
V,II,Scout,"And happiness to his accomplices!"
V,II,CHARLES,"What tidings send our scouts? I prithee, speak."
V,II,Scout,"The English army, that divided was"
V,II,Scout,"Into two parties, is now conjoined in one,"
V,II,Scout,"And means to give you battle presently."
V,II,CHARLES,"Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;"
V,II,CHARLES,"But we will presently provide for them."
V,II,BURGUNDY,"I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there:"
V,II,BURGUNDY,"Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear."
V,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Of all base passions, fear is most accursed."
V,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,"
V,II,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Let Henry fret and all the world repine."
V,II,CHARLES,"Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"The regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Now help, ye charming spells and periapts;"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And ye choice spirits that admonish me"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And give me signs of future accidents."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"You speedy helpers, that are substitutes"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Under the lordly monarch of the north,"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Appear and aid me in this enterprise."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"This speedy and quick appearance argues proof"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Of your accustom'd diligence to me."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Out of the powerful regions under earth,"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Help me this once, that France may get the field."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O, hold me not with silence over-long!"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I'll lop a member off and give it you"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"In earnest of further benefit,"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"So you do condescend to help me now."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"No hope to have redress? My body shall"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Before that England give the French the foil."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"See, they forsake me! Now the time is come"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And let her head fall into England's lap."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"My ancient incantations are too weak,"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And hell too strong for me to buckle with:"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust."
V,III,YORK,"Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:"
V,III,YORK,"Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms"
V,III,YORK,"And try if they can gain your liberty."
V,III,YORK,"A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!"
V,III,YORK,"See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,"
V,III,YORK,"As if with Circe she would change my shape!"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be."
V,III,YORK,"O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man;"
V,III,YORK,"No shape but his can please your dainty eye."
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And may ye both be suddenly surprised"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!"
V,III,YORK,"Fell banning hag, enchantress, hold thy tongue!"
V,III,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I prithee, give me leave to curse awhile."
V,III,YORK,"Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And lay them gently on thy tender side."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee."
V,III,MARGARET,"Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,"
V,III,MARGARET,"The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Be not offended, nature's miracle,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Yet, if this servile usage once offend."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"O, stay! I have no power to let her pass;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"My hand would free her, but my heart says no"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Twinkling another counterfeited beam,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Hast not a tongue? is she not here?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough."
V,III,MARGARET,"Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--"
V,III,MARGARET,"What ransom must I pay before I pass?"
V,III,MARGARET,"For I perceive I am thy prisoner."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Before thou make a trial of her love?"
V,III,MARGARET,"Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"She is a woman, therefore to be won."
V,III,MARGARET,"Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?"
V,III,MARGARET,"I were best to leave him, for he will not hear."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card."
V,III,MARGARET,"He talks at random; sure, the man is mad."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And yet a dispensation may be had."
V,III,MARGARET,"And yet I would that you would answer me."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!"
V,III,MARGARET,"He talks of wood: it is some carpenter."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And peace established between these realms"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"But there remains a scruple in that too;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"For though her father be the King of Naples,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And our nobility will scorn the match."
V,III,MARGARET,"Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Henry is youthful and will quickly yield."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Madam, I have a secret to reveal."
V,III,MARGARET,"What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,"
V,III,MARGARET,"And will not any way dishonour me."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say."
V,III,MARGARET,"Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;"
V,III,MARGARET,"And then I need not crave his courtesy."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--"
V,III,MARGARET,"Tush, women have been captivate ere now."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Lady, wherefore talk you so?"
V,III,MARGARET,"I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?"
V,III,MARGARET,"To be a queen in bondage is more vile"
V,III,MARGARET,"Than is a slave in base servility;"
V,III,MARGARET,"For princes should be free."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And so shall you,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"If happy England's royal king be free."
V,III,MARGARET,"Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"To put a golden sceptre in thy hand"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And set a precious crown upon thy head,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"If thou wilt condescend to be my--"
V,III,MARGARET,"What?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"His love."
V,III,MARGARET,"I am unworthy to be Henry's wife."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"No, gentle madam; I unworthy am"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And have no portion in the choice myself."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"How say you, madam, are ye so content?"
V,III,MARGARET,"An if my father please, I am content."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Then call our captains and our colours forth."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And, madam, at your father's castle walls"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"We'll crave a parley, to confer with him."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!"
V,III,REIGNIER,"To whom?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"To me."
V,III,REIGNIER,"Suffolk, what remedy?"
V,III,REIGNIER,"I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,"
V,III,REIGNIER,"Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Consent, and for thy honour give consent,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And this her easy-held imprisonment"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty."
V,III,REIGNIER,"Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Fair Margaret knows"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign."
V,III,REIGNIER,"Upon thy princely warrant, I descend"
V,III,REIGNIER,"To give thee answer of thy just demand."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And here I will expect thy coming."
V,III,REIGNIER,"Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:"
V,III,REIGNIER,"Command in Anjou what your honour pleases."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Fit to be made companion with a king:"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"What answer makes your grace unto my suit?"
V,III,REIGNIER,"Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth"
V,III,REIGNIER,"To be the princely bride of such a lord;"
V,III,REIGNIER,"Upon condition I may quietly"
V,III,REIGNIER,"Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,"
V,III,REIGNIER,"Free from oppression or the stroke of war,"
V,III,REIGNIER,"My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"That is her ransom; I deliver her;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And those two counties I will undertake"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy."
V,III,REIGNIER,"And I again, in Henry's royal name,"
V,III,REIGNIER,"As deputy unto that gracious king,"
V,III,REIGNIER,"Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Because this is in traffic of a king."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And yet, methinks, I could be well content"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"To be mine own attorney in this case."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"I'll over then to England with this news,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And make this marriage to be solemnized."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"In golden palaces, as it becomes."
V,III,REIGNIER,"I do embrace thee, as I would embrace"
V,III,REIGNIER,"The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here."
V,III,MARGARET,"Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers"
V,III,MARGARET,"Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"No princely commendations to my king?"
V,III,MARGARET,"Such commendations as becomes a maid,"
V,III,MARGARET,"A virgin and his servant, say to him."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Words sweetly placed and modestly directed."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"But madam, I must trouble you again;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"No loving token to his majesty?"
V,III,MARGARET,"Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,"
V,III,MARGARET,"Never yet taint with love, I send the king."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And this withal."
V,III,MARGARET,"That for thyself: I will not so presume"
V,III,MARGARET,"To send such peevish tokens to a king."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And natural graces that extinguish art;"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Repeat their semblance often on the seas,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder."
V,IV,YORK,"Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn."
V,IV,Shepherd,"Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Have I sought every country far and near,"
V,IV,Shepherd,"And, now it is my chance to find thee out,"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I am descended of a gentler blood:"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Thou art no father nor no friend of mine."
V,IV,Shepherd,"Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;"
V,IV,Shepherd,"I did beget her, all the parish knows:"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Her mother liveth yet, can testify"
V,IV,Shepherd,"She was the first fruit of my bachelorship."
V,IV,WARWICK,"Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?"
V,IV,YORK,"This argues what her kind of life hath been,"
V,IV,YORK,"Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes."
V,IV,Shepherd,"Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!"
V,IV,Shepherd,"God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;"
V,IV,Shepherd,"And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Of purpose to obscure my noble birth."
V,IV,Shepherd,"'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest"
V,IV,Shepherd,"The morn that I was wedded to her mother."
V,IV,Shepherd,"Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl."
V,IV,Shepherd,"Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Of thy nativity! I would the milk"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,"
V,IV,Shepherd,"I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!"
V,IV,Shepherd,"Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?"
V,IV,Shepherd,"O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good."
V,IV,YORK,"Take her away; for she hath lived too long,"
V,IV,YORK,"To fill the world with vicious qualities."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But issued from the progeny of kings;"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"By inspiration of celestial grace,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To work exceeding miracles on earth."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I never had to do with wicked spirits:"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But you, that are polluted with your lusts,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Because you want the grace that others have,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"You judge it straight a thing impossible"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To compass wonders but by help of devils."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"A virgin from her tender infancy,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Chaste and immaculate in very thought;"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven."
V,IV,YORK,"Ay, ay: away with her to execution!"
V,IV,WARWICK,"And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,"
V,IV,WARWICK,"Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:"
V,IV,WARWICK,"Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,"
V,IV,WARWICK,"That so her torture may be shortened."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That warranteth by law to be thy privilege."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I am with child, ye bloody homicides:"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Murder not then the fruit within my womb,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Although ye hale me to a violent death."
V,IV,YORK,"Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!"
V,IV,WARWICK,"The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:"
V,IV,WARWICK,"Is all your strict preciseness come to this?"
V,IV,YORK,"She and the Dauphin have been juggling:"
V,IV,YORK,"I did imagine what would be her refuge."
V,IV,WARWICK,"Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;"
V,IV,WARWICK,"Especially since Charles must father it."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"You are deceived; my child is none of his:"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love."
V,IV,YORK,"Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!"
V,IV,YORK,"It dies, an if it had a thousand lives."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O, give me leave, I have deluded you:"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd."
V,IV,WARWICK,"A married man! that's most intolerable."
V,IV,YORK,"Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,"
V,IV,YORK,"There were so many, whom she may accuse."
V,IV,WARWICK,"It's sign she hath been liberal and free."
V,IV,YORK,"And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure."
V,IV,YORK,"Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:"
V,IV,YORK,"Use no entreaty, for it is in vain."
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"May never glorious sun reflex his beams"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Upon the country where you make abode;"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But darkness and the gloomy shade of death"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Environ you, till mischief and despair"
V,IV,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!"
V,IV,YORK,"Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,"
V,IV,YORK,"Thou foul accursed minister of hell!"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Lord regent, I do greet your excellence"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"With letters of commission from the king."
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Have earnestly implored a general peace"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"And here at hand the Dauphin and his train"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Approacheth, to confer about some matter."
V,IV,YORK,"Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?"
V,IV,YORK,"After the slaughter of so many peers,"
V,IV,YORK,"So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,"
V,IV,YORK,"That in this quarrel have been overthrown"
V,IV,YORK,"And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,"
V,IV,YORK,"Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?"
V,IV,YORK,"Have we not lost most part of all the towns,"
V,IV,YORK,"By treason, falsehood and by treachery,"
V,IV,YORK,"Our great progenitors had conquered?"
V,IV,YORK,"O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief"
V,IV,YORK,"The utter loss of all the realm of France."
V,IV,WARWICK,"Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,"
V,IV,WARWICK,"It shall be with such strict and severe covenants"
V,IV,WARWICK,"As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby."
V,IV,CHARLES,"Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed"
V,IV,CHARLES,"That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,"
V,IV,CHARLES,"We come to be informed by yourselves"
V,IV,CHARLES,"What the conditions of that league must be."
V,IV,YORK,"Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes"
V,IV,YORK,"The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,"
V,IV,YORK,"By sight of these our baleful enemies."
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"That, in regard King Henry gives consent,"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Of mere compassion and of lenity,"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"To ease your country of distressful war,"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"You shall become true liegemen to his crown:"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"To pay him tribute, submit thyself,"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,"
V,IV,CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER,"And still enjoy thy regal dignity."
V,IV,ALENCON,"Must he be then as shadow of himself?"
V,IV,ALENCON,"Adorn his temples with a coronet,"
V,IV,ALENCON,"And yet, in substance and authority,"
V,IV,ALENCON,"Retain but privilege of a private man?"
V,IV,ALENCON,"This proffer is absurd and reasonless."
V,IV,CHARLES,"'Tis known already that I am possess'd"
V,IV,CHARLES,"With more than half the Gallian territories,"
V,IV,CHARLES,"And therein reverenced for their lawful king:"
V,IV,CHARLES,"Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,"
V,IV,CHARLES,"Detract so much from that prerogative,"
V,IV,CHARLES,"As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?"
V,IV,CHARLES,"No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep"
V,IV,CHARLES,"That which I have than, coveting for more,"
V,IV,CHARLES,"Be cast from possibility of all."
V,IV,YORK,"Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means"
V,IV,YORK,"Used intercession to obtain a league,"
V,IV,YORK,"And, now the matter grows to compromise,"
V,IV,YORK,"Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?"
V,IV,YORK,"Either accept the title thou usurp'st,"
V,IV,YORK,"Of benefit proceeding from our king"
V,IV,YORK,"And not of any challenge of desert,"
V,IV,YORK,"Or we will plague thee with incessant wars."
V,IV,REIGNIER,"My lord, you do not well in obstinacy"
V,IV,REIGNIER,"To cavil in the course of this contract:"
V,IV,REIGNIER,"If once it be neglected, ten to one"
V,IV,REIGNIER,"We shall not find like opportunity."
V,IV,ALENCON,"To say the truth, it is your policy"
V,IV,ALENCON,"To save your subjects from such massacre"
V,IV,ALENCON,"And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen"
V,IV,ALENCON,"By our proceeding in hostility;"
V,IV,ALENCON,"And therefore take this compact of a truce,"
V,IV,ALENCON,"Although you break it when your pleasure serves."
V,IV,WARWICK,"How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?"
V,IV,CHARLES,"It shall;"
V,IV,CHARLES,"Only reserved, you claim no interest"
V,IV,CHARLES,"In any of our towns of garrison."
V,IV,YORK,"Then swear allegiance to his majesty,"
V,IV,YORK,"As thou art knight, never to disobey"
V,IV,YORK,"Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,"
V,IV,YORK,"Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England."
V,IV,YORK,"So, now dismiss your army when ye please:"
V,IV,YORK,"Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,"
V,IV,YORK,"For here we entertain a solemn peace."
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Her virtues graced with external gifts"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"So am I driven by breath of her renown"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Where I may have fruition of her love."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Is but a preface of her worthy praise;"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"The chief perfections of that lovely dame"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Had I sufficient skill to utter them,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Would make a volume of enticing lines,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Able to ravish any dull conceit:"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"And, which is more, she is not so divine,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"So full-replete with choice of all delights,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"But with as humble lowliness of mind"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"She is content to be at your command;"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"To love and honour Henry as her lord."
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume."
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, my lord protector, give consent"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"That Margaret may be England's royal queen."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"So should I give consent to flatter sin."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Unto another lady of esteem:"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"How shall we then dispense with that contract,"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"And not deface your honour with reproach?"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"By reason of his adversary's odds:"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"And therefore may be broke without offence."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Her father is no better than an earl,"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Although in glorious titles he excel."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Yes, lord, her father is a king,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"The King of Naples and Jerusalem;"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"And of such great authority in France"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"As his alliance will confirm our peace"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Because he is near kinsman unto Charles."
V,V,EXETER,"Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,"
V,V,EXETER,"Where Reignier sooner will receive than give."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"That he should be so abject, base and poor,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"To choose for wealth and not for perfect love."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Henry is able to enrich his queen"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"And not seek a queen to make him rich:"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Marriage is a matter of more worth"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Must be companion of his nuptial bed:"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"It most of all these reasons bindeth us,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"In our opinions she should be preferr'd."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"For what is wedlock forced but a hell,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"An age of discord and continual strife?"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"And is a pattern of celestial peace."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Approves her fit for none but for a king:"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"More than in women commonly is seen,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Will answer our hope in issue of a king;"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"For Henry, son unto a conqueror,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Is likely to beget more conquerors,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"If with a lady of so high resolve"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she."
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Whether it be through force of your report,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"My tender youth was never yet attaint"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"With any passion of inflaming love,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"I cannot tell; but this I am assured,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"As I am sick with working of my thoughts."
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Agree to any covenants, and procure"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"To cross the seas to England and be crown'd"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"For your expenses and sufficient charge,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Among the people gather up a tenth."
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"I rest perplexed with a thousand cares."
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"And you, good uncle, banish all offence:"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"If you do censure me by what you were,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"Not what you are, I know it will excuse"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"This sudden execution of my will."
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"And so, conduct me where, from company,"
V,V,KING HENRY VI,"I may revolve and ruminate my grief."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"With hope to find the like event in love,"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"But prosper better than the Trojan did."
V,V,SUFFOLK,"Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;"
V,V,SUFFOLK,"But I will rule both her, the king and realm."
