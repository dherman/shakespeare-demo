I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Which then our leisure would not let us hear,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?"
I,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"I have, my liege."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Or worthily, as a good subject should,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"On some known ground of treachery in him?"
I,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"As near as I could sift him on that argument,"
I,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"On some apparent danger seen in him"
I,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Then call them to our presence; face to face,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"The accuser and the accused freely speak:"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Many years of happy days befal"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Each day still better other's happiness;"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Add an immortal title to your crown!"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"As well appeareth by the cause you come;"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Namely to appeal each other of high treason."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"First, heaven be the record to my speech!"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In the devotion of a subject's love,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Tendering the precious safety of my prince,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And free from other misbegotten hate,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Come I appellant to this princely presence."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And mark my greeting well; for what I speak"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My body shall make good upon this earth,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Or my divine soul answer it in heaven."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Too good to be so and too bad to live,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Once more, the more to aggravate the note,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Yet can I not of such tame patience boast"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which else would post until it had return'd"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"These terms of treason doubled down his throat."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Setting aside his high blood's royalty,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And let him be no kinsman to my liege,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I do defy him, and I spit at him;"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which to maintain I would allow him odds,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And meet him, were I tied to run afoot"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Or any other ground inhabitable,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Where ever Englishman durst set his foot."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Mean time let this defend my loyalty,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And lay aside my high blood's royalty,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"If guilty dread have left thee so much strength"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By that and all the rites of knighthood else,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I take it up; and by that sword I swear"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I'll answer thee in any fair degree,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And when I mount, alive may I not light,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"If I be traitor or unjustly fight!"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"It must be great that can inherit us"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"So much as of a thought of ill in him."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Like a false traitor and injurious villain."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Besides I say and will in battle prove,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That ever was survey'd by English eye,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That all the treasons for these eighteen years"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Complotted and contrived in this land"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Further I say and further will maintain"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Upon his bad life to make all this good,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And consequently, like a traitor coward,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To me for justice and rough chastisement;"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And, by the glorious worth of my descent,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"This arm shall do it, or this life be spent."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"How high a pitch his resolution soars!"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"O, let my sovereign turn away his face"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And bid his ears a little while be deaf,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Till I have told this slander of his blood,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"How God and good men hate so foul a liar."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"As he is but my father's brother's son,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Free speech and fearless I to thee allow."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The other part reserved I by consent,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"For that my sovereign liege was in my debt"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Upon remainder of a dear account,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I slew him not; but to my own disgrace"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Neglected my sworn duty in that case."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The honourable father to my foe"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Once did I lay an ambush for your life,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"But ere I last received the sacrament"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I did confess it, and exactly begg'd"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"It issues from the rancour of a villain,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A recreant and most degenerate traitor"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which in myself I boldly will defend;"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And interchangeably hurl down my gage"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Upon this overweening traitor's foot,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"To prove myself a loyal gentleman"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"In haste whereof, most heartily I pray"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Your highness to assign our trial day."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Let's purge this choler without letting blood:"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"This we prescribe, though no physician;"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Deep malice makes too deep incision;"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Our doctors say this is no month to bleed."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Good uncle, let this end where it begun;"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son."
I,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"To be a make-peace shall become my age:"
I,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"And, Norfolk, throw down his."
I,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"When, Harry, when?"
I,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Obedience bids I should not bid again."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The one my duty owes; but my fair name,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Despite of death that lives upon my grave,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which breathed this poison."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Rage must be withstood:"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The purest treasure mortal times afford"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Is spotless reputation: that away,"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Men are but gilded loam or painted clay."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast."
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Take honour from me, and my life is done:"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;"
I,I,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"In that I live and for that will I die."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin."
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The slavish motive of recanting fear,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,"
I,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"We were not born to sue, but to command;"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Which since we cannot do to make you friends,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"There shall your swords and lances arbitrate"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"The swelling difference of your settled hate:"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Since we can not atone you, we shall see"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Justice design the victor's chivalry."
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Lord marshal, command our officers at arms"
I,I,KING RICHARD II,"Be ready to direct these home alarms."
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"To stir against the butchers of his life!"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But since correction lieth in those hands"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Which made the fault that we cannot correct,"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Or seven fair branches springing from one root:"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;"
I,II,DUCHESS,"But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"One flourishing branch of his most royal root,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent"
I,II,DUCHESS,"In some large measure to thy father's death,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Who was the model of thy father's life."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:"
I,II,DUCHESS,"In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:"
I,II,DUCHESS,"That which in mean men we intitle patience"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts."
I,II,DUCHESS,"What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death."
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"His deputy anointed in His sight,"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"An angry arm against His minister."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Where then, alas, may I complain myself?"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"To God, the widow's champion and defence."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:"
I,II,DUCHESS,"O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Or, if misfortune miss the first career,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"They may break his foaming courser's back,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"And throw the rider headlong in the lists,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife"
I,II,DUCHESS,"With her companion grief must end her life."
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:"
I,II,JOHN OF GAUNT,"As much good stay with thee as go with me!"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:"
I,II,DUCHESS,"I take my leave before I have begun,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Though this be all, do not so quickly go;"
I,II,DUCHESS,"I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--"
I,II,DUCHESS,"With all good speed at Plashy visit me."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Alack, and what shall good old York there see"
I,II,DUCHESS,"But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?"
I,II,DUCHESS,"And what hear there for welcome but my groans?"
I,II,DUCHESS,"Therefore commend me; let him not come there,"
I,II,DUCHESS,"To seek out sorrow that dwells every where."
I,II,DUCHESS,"Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:"
I,II,DUCHESS,"The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?"
I,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet."
I,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay"
I,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"For nothing but his majesty's approach."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Marshal, demand of yonder champion"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"The cause of his arrival here in arms:"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Ask him his name and orderly proceed"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"To swear him in the justice of his cause."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"In God's name and the king's, say who thou art"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Who hither come engaged by my oath--"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which God defend a knight should violate!--"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Both to defend my loyalty and truth"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"To God, my king and my succeeding issue,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"To prove him, in defending of myself,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A traitor to my God, my king, and me:"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Both who he is and why he cometh hither"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Thus plated in habiliments of war,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"And formally, according to our law,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Depose him in the justice of his cause."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Before King Richard in his royal lists?"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"On pain of death, no person be so bold"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Except the marshal and such officers"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Appointed to direct these fair designs."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And bow my knee before his majesty:"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"For Mowbray and myself are like two men"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Then let us take a ceremonious leave"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And loving farewell of our several friends."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"The appellant in all duty greets your highness,"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"We will descend and fold him in our arms."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"So be thy fortune in this royal fight!"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O let no noble eye profane a tear"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As confident as is the falcon's flight"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My loving lord, I take my leave of you;"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Not sick, although I have to do with death,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O thou, the earthly author of my blood,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To reach at victory above my head,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Even in the lusty havior of his son."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Be swift like lightning in the execution;"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Fall like amazing thunder on the casque"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"However God or fortune cast my lot,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A loyal, just and upright gentleman:"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Never did captive with a freer heart"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"More than my dancing soul doth celebrate"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"This feast of battle with mine adversary."
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"As gentle and as jocund as to jest"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Farewell, my lord: securely I espy"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Virtue with valour couched in thine eye."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Order the trial, marshal, and begin."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk."
I,III,First Herald,"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,"
I,III,First Herald,"Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,"
I,III,First Herald,"On pain to be found false and recreant,"
I,III,First Herald,"To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,"
I,III,First Herald,"A traitor to his God, his king and him;"
I,III,First Herald,"And dares him to set forward to the fight."
I,III,Second Herald,"Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,"
I,III,Second Herald,"On pain to be found false and recreant,"
I,III,Second Herald,"Both to defend himself and to approve"
I,III,Second Herald,"Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,"
I,III,Second Herald,"To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;"
I,III,Second Herald,"Courageously and with a free desire"
I,III,Second Herald,"Attending but the signal to begin."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"And both return back to their chairs again:"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"While we return these dukes what we decree."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Draw near,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"And list what with our council we have done."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"With that dear blood which it hath fostered;"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"And for we think the eagle-winged pride"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"With rival-hating envy, set on you"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Therefore, we banish you our territories:"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Shall not regreet our fair dominions,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"But tread the stranger paths of banishment."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Your will be done: this must my comfort be,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And those his golden beams to you here lent"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Shall point on me and gild my banishment."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"The sly slow hours shall not determinate"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"The dateless limit of thy dear exile;"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"The hopeless word of 'never to return'"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life."
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A dearer merit, not so deep a maim"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"As to be cast forth in the common air,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Have I deserved at your highness' hands."
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The language I have learn'd these forty years,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"My native English, now I must forego:"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And now my tongue's use is to me no more"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Than an unstringed viol or a harp,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Or like a cunning instrument cased up,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Or, being open, put into his hands"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"That knows no touch to tune the harmony:"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And dull unfeeling barren ignorance"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Is made my gaoler to attend on me."
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Too far in years to be a pupil now:"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"What is thy sentence then but speechless death,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"It boots thee not to be compassionate:"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"After our sentence plaining comes too late."
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Then thus I turn me from my country's light,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"To dwell in solemn shades of endless night."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Return again, and take an oath with thee."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Swear by the duty that you owe to God--"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Our part therein we banish with yourselves--"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"To keep the oath that we administer:"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"You never shall, so help you truth and God!"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Embrace each other's love in banishment;"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Nor never look upon each other's face;"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Nor never by advised purpose meet"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"To plot, contrive, or complot any ill"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I swear."
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And I, to keep all this."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By this time, had the king permitted us,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"One of our souls had wander'd in the air."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Since thou hast far to go, bear not along"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The clogging burthen of a guilty soul."
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"My name be blotted from the book of life,"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue."
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;"
I,III,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Save back to England, all the world's my way."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Hath from the number of his banish'd years"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Pluck'd four away."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Six frozen winter spent,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Return with welcome home from banishment."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"How long a time lies in one little word!"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Four lagging winters and four wanton springs"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"End in a word: such is the breath of kings."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"I thank my liege, that in regard of me"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"He shortens four years of my son's exile:"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But little vantage shall I reap thereby;"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"For, ere the six years that he hath to spend"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Can change their moons and bring their times about"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Shall be extinct with age and endless night;"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"My inch of taper will be burnt and done,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And blindfold death not let me see my son."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Why uncle, thou hast many years to live."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Thy word is current with him for my death,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"You urged me as a judge; but I had rather"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"You would have bid me argue like a father."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O, had it been a stranger, not my child,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"A partial slander sought I to avoid,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And in the sentence my own life destroy'd."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"I was too strict to make mine own away;"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Against my will to do myself this wrong."
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:"
I,III,KING RICHARD II,"Six years we banish him, and he shall go."
I,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,"
I,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"From where you do remain let paper show."
I,III,Lord Marshal,"My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,"
I,III,Lord Marshal,"As far as land will let me, by your side."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I have too few to take my leave of you,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"When the tongue's office should be prodigal"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Thy grief is but thy absence for a time."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Joy absent, grief is present for that time."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"What is six winters? they are quickly gone."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The sullen passage of thy weary steps"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The precious jewel of thy home return."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Will but remember me what a deal of world"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I wander from the jewels that I love."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Must I not serve a long apprenticehood"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To foreign passages, and in the end,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Having my freedom, boast of nothing else"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But that I was a journeyman to grief?"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"All places that the eye of heaven visits"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Are to a wise man ports and happy havens."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Teach thy necessity to reason thus;"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"There is no virtue like necessity."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Think not the king did banish thee,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Where it perceives it is but faintly borne."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And not the king exiled thee; or suppose"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Devouring pestilence hangs in our air"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And thou art flying to a fresher clime:"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Suppose the singing birds musicians,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Than a delightful measure or a dance;"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The man that mocks at it and sets it light."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O, who can hold a fire in his hand"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By bare imagination of a feast?"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Or wallow naked in December snow"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O, no! the apprehension of the good"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore."
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:"
I,III,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay."
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,"
I,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"How far brought you high Hereford on his way?"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"But to the next highway, and there I left him."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"And say, what store of parting tears were shed?"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Which then blew bitterly against our faces,"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Did grace our hollow parting with a tear."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"What said our cousin when you parted with him?"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"'Farewell:'"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"And, for my heart disdained that my tongue"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Should so profane the word, that taught me craft"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"To counterfeit oppression of such grief"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave."
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"And added years to his short banishment,"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"He should have had a volume of farewells;"
I,IV,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"But since it would not, he had none of me."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"When time shall call him home from banishment,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Whether our kinsman come to see his friends."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Observed his courtship to the common people;"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"How he did seem to dive into their hearts"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"With humble and familiar courtesy,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"What reverence he did throw away on slaves,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"And patient underbearing of his fortune,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"As 'twere to banish their affects with him."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"A brace of draymen bid God speed him well"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"And had the tribute of his supple knee,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"As were our England in reversion his,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"And he our subjects' next degree in hope."
I,IV,GREEN,"Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts."
I,IV,GREEN,"Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,"
I,IV,GREEN,"Expedient manage must be made, my liege,"
I,IV,GREEN,"Ere further leisure yield them further means"
I,IV,GREEN,"For their advantage and your highness' loss."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"We will ourself in person to this war:"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"And, for our coffers, with too great a court"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"We are inforced to farm our royal realm;"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"The revenue whereof shall furnish us"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"For our affairs in hand: if that come short,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"And send them after to supply our wants;"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"For we will make for Ireland presently."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Bushy, what news?"
I,IV,BUSHY,"Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,"
I,IV,BUSHY,"Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste"
I,IV,BUSHY,"To entreat your majesty to visit him."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Where lies he?"
I,IV,BUSHY,"At Ely House."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Now put it, God, in the physician's mind"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"To help him to his grave immediately!"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"The lining of his coffers shall make coats"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars."
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:"
I,IV,KING RICHARD II,"Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!"
I,IV,All,"Amen."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Will the king come, that I may breathe my last"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"For all in vain comes counsel to his ear."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O, but they say the tongues of dying men"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Enforce attention like deep harmony:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"He that no more must say is listen'd more"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The setting sun, and music at the close,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Writ in remembrance more than things long past:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"The open ear of youth doth always listen;"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Report of fashions in proud Italy,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Whose manners still our tardy apish nation"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Limps after in base imitation."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"So it be new, there's no respect how vile--"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Direct not him whose way himself will choose:"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Methinks I am a prophet new inspired"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And thus expiring do foretell of him:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"For violent fires soon burn out themselves;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Consuming means, soon preys upon itself."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This other Eden, demi-paradise,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This fortress built by Nature for herself"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Against infection and the hand of war,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This happy breed of men, this little world,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This precious stone set in the silver sea,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Which serves it in the office of a wall,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Or as a moat defensive to a house,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Against the envy of less happier lands,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Renowned for their deeds as far from home,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"For Christian service and true chivalry,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Dear for her reputation through the world,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Like to a tenement or pelting farm:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"England, bound in with the triumphant sea"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"That England, that was wont to conquer others,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Hath made a shameful conquest of itself."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"How happy then were my ensuing death!"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"For young hot colts being raged do rage the more."
II,I,QUEEN,"How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O how that name befits my composition!"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Can sick men play so nicely with their names?"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"No, misery makes sport to mock itself:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Should dying men flatter with those that live?"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"No, no, men living flatter those that die."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And thou, too careless patient as thou art,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Of those physicians that first wounded thee:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And yet, incaged in so small a verge,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The waste is no whit lesser than thy land."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Which art possess'd now to depose thyself."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"It were a shame to let this land by lease;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But for thy world enjoying but this land,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Is it not more than shame to shame it so?"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Landlord of England art thou now, not king:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"A lunatic lean-witted fool,"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Presuming on an ague's privilege,"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Darest with thy frozen admonition"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"With fury from his native residence."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"For that I was his father Edward's son;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"That blood already, like the pelican,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"May be a precedent and witness good"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Join with the present sickness that I have;"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And thy unkindness be like crooked age,"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"To crop at once a too long wither'd flower."
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"These words hereafter thy tormentors be!"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:"
II,I,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Love they to live that love and honour have."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"And let them die that age and sullens have;"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"For both hast thou, and both become the grave."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"I do beseech your majesty, impute his words"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"To wayward sickliness and age in him:"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"What says he?"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Nay, nothing; all is said"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"His tongue is now a stringless instrument;"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Which live like venom where no venom else"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"But only they have privilege to live."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"And for these great affairs do ask some charge,"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Towards our assistance we do seize to us"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"How long shall I be patient? ah, how long"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"I am the last of noble Edward's sons,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"In war was never lion raged more fierce,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Than was that young and princely gentleman."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"But when he frown'd, it was against the French"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"And not against his friends; his noble hand"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Did will what he did spend and spent not that"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Which his triumphant father's hand had won;"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"But bloody with the enemies of his kin."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Or else he never would compare between."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Why, uncle, what's the matter?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"O my liege,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Not to be pardon'd, am content withal."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Did not the one deserve to have an heir?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Is not his heir a well-deserving son?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"His charters and his customary rights;"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Be not thyself; for how art thou a king"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"But by fair sequence and succession?"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Call in the letters patent that he hath"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"By his attorneys-general to sue"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Which honour and allegiance cannot think."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Think what you will, we seize into our hands"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"His plate, his goods, his money and his lands."
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"But by bad courses may be understood"
II,I,DUKE OF YORK,"That their events can never fall out good."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Bid him repair to us to Ely House"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"To see this business. To-morrow next"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"And we create, in absence of ourself,"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Our uncle York lord governor of England;"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"For he is just and always loved us well."
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;"
II,I,KING RICHARD II,"Be merry, for our time of stay is short"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"And living too; for now his son is duke."
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Barely in title, not in revenue."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Richly in both, if justice had her right."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"My heart is great; but it must break with silence,"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!"
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?"
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"If it be so, out with it boldly, man;"
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"No good at all that I can do for him;"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"Unless you call it good to pity him,"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"Bereft and gelded of his patrimony."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"In him, a royal prince, and many moe"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Of noble blood in this declining land."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The king is not himself, but basely led"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"By flatterers; and what they will inform,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That will the king severely prosecute"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts."
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And daily new exactions are devised,"
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:"
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But basely yielded upon compromise"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"More hath he spent in peace than they in wars."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm."
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"He hath not money for these Irish wars,"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"But by the robbing of the banish'd duke."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And yet we strike not, but securely perish."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"We see the very wreck that we must suffer;"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"And unavoided is the danger now,"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"For suffering so the causes of our wreck."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"I spy life peering; but I dare not say"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"How near the tidings of our comfort is."
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"Be confident to speak, Northumberland:"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,"
II,I,LORD ROSS,"Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"In Brittany, received intelligence"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Are making hither with all due expedience"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The first departing of the king for Ireland."
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And make high majesty look like itself,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But if you faint, as fearing to do so,"
II,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Stay and be secret, and myself will go."
II,I,LORD ROSS,"To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear."
II,I,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Hold out my horse, and I will first be there."
II,II,BUSHY,"Madam, your majesty is too much sad:"
II,II,BUSHY,"You promised, when you parted with the king,"
II,II,BUSHY,"To lay aside life-harming heaviness"
II,II,BUSHY,"And entertain a cheerful disposition."
II,II,QUEEN,"To please the king I did; to please myself"
II,II,QUEEN,"I cannot do it; yet I know no cause"
II,II,QUEEN,"Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,"
II,II,QUEEN,"Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest"
II,II,QUEEN,"As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,"
II,II,QUEEN,"Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,"
II,II,QUEEN,"Is coming towards me, and my inward soul"
II,II,QUEEN,"With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,"
II,II,QUEEN,"More than with parting from my lord the king."
II,II,BUSHY,"Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,"
II,II,BUSHY,"Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;"
II,II,BUSHY,"For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,"
II,II,BUSHY,"Divides one thing entire to many objects;"
II,II,BUSHY,"Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon"
II,II,BUSHY,"Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry"
II,II,BUSHY,"Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,"
II,II,BUSHY,"Looking awry upon your lord's departure,"
II,II,BUSHY,"Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;"
II,II,BUSHY,"Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows"
II,II,BUSHY,"Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,"
II,II,BUSHY,"More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;"
II,II,BUSHY,"Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,"
II,II,BUSHY,"Which for things true weeps things imaginary."
II,II,QUEEN,"It may be so; but yet my inward soul"
II,II,QUEEN,"Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,"
II,II,QUEEN,"I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad"
II,II,QUEEN,"As, though on thinking on no thought I think,"
II,II,QUEEN,"Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink."
II,II,BUSHY,"'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady."
II,II,QUEEN,"'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived"
II,II,QUEEN,"From some forefather grief; mine is not so,"
II,II,QUEEN,"For nothing had begot my something grief;"
II,II,QUEEN,"Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:"
II,II,QUEEN,"'Tis in reversion that I do possess;"
II,II,QUEEN,"But what it is, that is not yet known; what"
II,II,QUEEN,"I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot."
II,II,GREEN,"God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:"
II,II,GREEN,"I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland."
II,II,QUEEN,"Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;"
II,II,QUEEN,"For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:"
II,II,QUEEN,"Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?"
II,II,GREEN,"That he, our hope, might have retired his power,"
II,II,GREEN,"And driven into despair an enemy's hope,"
II,II,GREEN,"Who strongly hath set footing in this land:"
II,II,GREEN,"The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,"
II,II,GREEN,"And with uplifted arms is safe arrived"
II,II,GREEN,"At Ravenspurgh."
II,II,QUEEN,"Now God in heaven forbid!"
II,II,GREEN,"Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,"
II,II,GREEN,"The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,"
II,II,GREEN,"The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,"
II,II,GREEN,"With all their powerful friends, are fled to him."
II,II,BUSHY,"Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland"
II,II,BUSHY,"And all the rest revolted faction traitors?"
II,II,GREEN,"We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester"
II,II,GREEN,"Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,"
II,II,GREEN,"And all the household servants fled with him"
II,II,GREEN,"To Bolingbroke."
II,II,QUEEN,"So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,"
II,II,QUEEN,"And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:"
II,II,QUEEN,"Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,"
II,II,QUEEN,"And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,"
II,II,QUEEN,"Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd."
II,II,BUSHY,"Despair not, madam."
II,II,QUEEN,"Who shall hinder me?"
II,II,QUEEN,"I will despair, and be at enmity"
II,II,QUEEN,"With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,"
II,II,QUEEN,"A parasite, a keeper back of death,"
II,II,QUEEN,"Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,"
II,II,QUEEN,"Which false hope lingers in extremity."
II,II,GREEN,"Here comes the Duke of York."
II,II,QUEEN,"With signs of war about his aged neck:"
II,II,QUEEN,"O, full of careful business are his looks!"
II,II,QUEEN,"Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Your husband, he is gone to save far off,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Whilst others come to make him lose at home:"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Here am I left to underprop his land,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him."
II,II,Servant,"My lord, your son was gone before I came."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Hold, take my ring."
II,II,Servant,"My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,"
II,II,Servant,"To-day, as I came by, I called there;"
II,II,Servant,"But I shall grieve you to report the rest."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"What is't, knave?"
II,II,Servant,"An hour before I came, the duchess died."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"God for his mercy! what a tide of woes"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"I know not what to do: I would to God,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"So my untruth had not provoked him to it,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"The king had cut off my head with my brother's."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"How shall we do for money for these wars?"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And bring away the armour that is there."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Gentlemen, will you go muster men?"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"If I know how or which way to order these affairs"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And duty bids defend; the other again"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Dispose of you."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And meet me presently at Berkeley."
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"I should to Plashy too;"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"But time will not permit: all is uneven,"
II,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And every thing is left at six and seven."
II,II,BUSHY,"The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,"
II,II,BUSHY,"But none returns. For us to levy power"
II,II,BUSHY,"Proportionable to the enemy"
II,II,BUSHY,"Is all unpossible."
II,II,GREEN,"Besides, our nearness to the king in love"
II,II,GREEN,"Is near the hate of those love not the king."
II,II,BAGOT,"And that's the wavering commons: for their love"
II,II,BAGOT,"Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them"
II,II,BAGOT,"By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate."
II,II,BUSHY,"Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd."
II,II,BAGOT,"If judgement lie in them, then so do we,"
II,II,BAGOT,"Because we ever have been near the king."
II,II,GREEN,"Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:"
II,II,GREEN,"The Earl of Wiltshire is already there."
II,II,BUSHY,"Thither will I with you; for little office"
II,II,BUSHY,"The hateful commons will perform for us,"
II,II,BUSHY,"Except like curs to tear us all to pieces."
II,II,BUSHY,"Will you go along with us?"
II,II,BAGOT,"No; I will to Ireland to his majesty."
II,II,BAGOT,"Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,"
II,II,BAGOT,"We three here art that ne'er shall meet again."
II,II,BUSHY,"That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke."
II,II,GREEN,"Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes"
II,II,GREEN,"Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:"
II,II,GREEN,"Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly."
II,II,GREEN,"Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever."
II,II,BUSHY,"Well, we may meet again."
II,II,BAGOT,"I fear me, never."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Believe me, noble lord,"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"These high wild hills and rough uneven ways"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Making the hard way sweet and delectable."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But I bethink me what a weary way"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The tediousness and process of my travel:"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The present benefit which I possess;"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And hope to joy is little less in joy"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"By sight of what I have, your noble company."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of much less value is my company"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Than your good words. But who comes here?"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"It is my son, young Harry Percy,"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Harry, how fares your uncle?"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Why, is he not with the queen?"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"Broken his staff of office and dispersed"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"The household of the king."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What was his reason?"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He was not so resolved when last we spake together."
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor."
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"What power the Duke of York had levied there;"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"No, my good lord, for that is not forgot"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"I never in my life did look on him."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Then learn to know him now; this is the duke."
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"My gracious lord, I tender you my service,"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"Which elder days shall ripen and confirm"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"To more approved service and desert."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I count myself in nothing else so happy"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As in a soul remembering my good friends;"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"It shall be still thy true love's recompense:"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Keeps good old York there with his men of war?"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;"
II,III,HENRY PERCY,"None else of name and noble estimate."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"A banish'd traitor: all my treasury"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Shall be your love and labour's recompense."
II,III,LORD ROSS,"Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord."
II,III,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And far surmounts our labour to attain it."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess."
II,III,LORD BERKELEY,"My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And I am come to seek that name in England;"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And I must find that title in your tongue,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Before I make reply to aught you say."
II,III,LORD BERKELEY,"Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning"
II,III,LORD BERKELEY,"To raze one title of your honour out:"
II,III,LORD BERKELEY,"To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,"
II,III,LORD BERKELEY,"From the most gracious regent of this land,"
II,III,LORD BERKELEY,"The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on"
II,III,LORD BERKELEY,"To take advantage of the absent time"
II,III,LORD BERKELEY,"And fright our native peace with self-born arms."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I shall not need transport my words by you;"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Whose duty is deceiveable and false."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious uncle--"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Tut, tut!"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"In an ungracious mouth is but profane."
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Frighting her pale-faced villages with war"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"And ostentation of despised arms?"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"And in my loyal bosom lies his power."
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Were I but now the lord of such hot youth"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"From forth the ranks of many thousand French,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"O, then how quickly should this arm of mine."
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"And minister correction to thy fault!"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"On what condition stands it and wherein?"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Even in condition of the worst degree,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"In gross rebellion and detested treason:"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Before the expiration of thy time,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"In braving arms against thy sovereign."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But as I come, I come for Lancaster."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"You are my father, for methinks in you"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"If that my cousin king be King of England,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I am denied to sue my livery here,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And yet my letters-patents give me leave:"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And these and all are all amiss employ'd."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What would you have me do? I am a subject,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And therefore, personally I lay my claim"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To my inheritance of free descent."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The noble duke hath been too much abused."
II,III,LORD ROSS,"It stands your grace upon to do him right."
II,III,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Base men by his endowments are made great."
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"My lords of England, let me tell you this:"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"And laboured all I could to do him right;"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"But in this kind to come, in braving arms,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Be his own carver and cut out his way,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"To find out right with wrong, it may not be;"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"And you that do abet him in this kind"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Cherish rebellion and are rebels all."
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The noble duke hath sworn his coming is"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But for his own; and for the right of that"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;"
II,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Because my power is weak and all ill left:"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"But if I could, by Him that gave me life,"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"I would attach you all and make you stoop"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"But since I cannot, be it known to you"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Unless you please to enter in the castle"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"And there repose you for this night."
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"An offer, uncle, that we will accept:"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But we must win your grace to go with us"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To Bristol castle, which they say is held"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The caterpillars of the commonwealth,"
II,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away."
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"For I am loath to break our country's laws."
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:"
II,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Things past redress are now with me past care."
II,IV,Captain,"My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,"
II,IV,Captain,"And hardly kept our countrymen together,"
II,IV,Captain,"And yet we hear no tidings from the king;"
II,IV,Captain,"Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell."
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:"
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"The king reposeth all his confidence in thee."
II,IV,Captain,"'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay."
II,IV,Captain,"The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd"
II,IV,Captain,"And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;"
II,IV,Captain,"The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth"
II,IV,Captain,"And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;"
II,IV,Captain,"Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,"
II,IV,Captain,"The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,"
II,IV,Captain,"The other to enjoy by rage and war:"
II,IV,Captain,"These signs forerun the death or fall of kings."
II,IV,Captain,"Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,"
II,IV,Captain,"As well assured Richard their king is dead."
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind"
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"I see thy glory like a shooting star"
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Fall to the base earth from the firmament."
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,"
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:"
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,"
II,IV,EARL OF SALISBURY,"And crossly to thy good all fortune goes."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Bring forth these men."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Since presently your souls must part your bodies--"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With too much urging your pernicious lives,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"From off my hands, here in the view of men"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I will unfold some causes of your deaths."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"You have misled a prince, a royal king,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By you unhappied and disfigured clean:"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"You have in manner with your sinful hours"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Broke the possession of a royal bed"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Near to the king in blood, and near in love"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Till you did make him misinterpret me,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Eating the bitter bread of banishment;"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Whilst you have fed upon my signories,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"From my own windows torn my household coat,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Save men's opinions and my living blood,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To show the world I am a gentleman."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"This and much more, much more than twice all this,"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To execution and the hand of death."
III,I,BUSHY,"More welcome is the stroke of death to me"
III,I,BUSHY,"Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell."
III,I,GREEN,"My comfort is that heaven will take our souls"
III,I,GREEN,"And plague injustice with the pains of hell."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Tell her I send to her my kind commends;"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Take special care my greetings be deliver'd."
III,I,DUKE OF YORK,"A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd"
III,I,DUKE OF YORK,"With letters of your love to her at large."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away."
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To fight with Glendower and his complices:"
III,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Awhile to work, and after holiday."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?"
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,"
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"After your late tossing on the breaking seas?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"To stand upon my kingdom once again."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"As a long-parted mother with her child"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And do thee favours with my royal hands."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Which with usurping steps do trample thee:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"This earth shall have a feeling and these stones"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms."
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Hath power to keep you king in spite of all."
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"The means that heaven yields must be embraced,"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And not neglected; else, if heaven would,"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"The proffer'd means of succor and redress."
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;"
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,"
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Grows strong and great in substance and in power."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"In murders and in outrage, boldly here;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"But when from under this terrestrial ball"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And darts his light through every guilty hole,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Then murders, treasons and detested sins,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Who all this while hath revell'd in the night"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"His treasons will sit blushing in his face,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Not able to endure the sight of day,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"But self-affrighted tremble at his sin."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Not all the water in the rough rude sea"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"The breath of worldly men cannot depose"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"The deputy elected by the Lord:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"And bids me speak of nothing but despair."
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"O, call back yesterday, bid time return,"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:"
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead."
III,II,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled."
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"But now the blood of twenty thousand men"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And, till so much blood thither come again,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Have I not reason to look pale and dead?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"All souls that will be safe fly from my side,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"For time hath set a blot upon my pride."
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Comfort, my liege; remember who you are."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"I had forgot myself; am I not king?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"More health and happiness betide my liege"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And what loss is it to be rid of care?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"They break their faith to God as well as us:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"The worst is death, and death will have his day."
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"To bear the tidings of calamity."
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Like an unseasonable stormy day,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"As if the world were all dissolved to tears,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"So high above his limits swells the rage"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel."
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Strive to speak big and clap their female joints"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Of double-fatal yew against thy state;"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"And all goes worse than I have power to tell."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"What is become of Bushy? where is Green?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"That they have let the dangerous enemy"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke."
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Would they make peace? terrible hell make war"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Upon their spotted souls for this offence!"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Sweet love, I see, changing his property,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground."
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads."
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Where is the duke my father with his power?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"No matter where; of comfort no man speak:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Let's choose executors and talk of wills:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And yet not so, for what can we bequeath"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Save our deposed bodies to the ground?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And nothing can we call our own but death"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And that small model of the barren earth"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Which serves as paste and cover to our bones."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"And tell sad stories of the death of kings;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"How some have been deposed; some slain in war,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"All murder'd: for within the hollow crown"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"That rounds the mortal temples of a king"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Allowing him a breath, a little scene,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Infusing him with self and vain conceit,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"As if this flesh which walls about our life,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Comes at the last and with a little pin"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"With solemn reverence: throw away respect,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"For you have but mistook me all this while:"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"I live with bread like you, feel want,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"How can you say to me, I am a king?"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"But presently prevent the ways to wail."
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And so your follies fight against yourself."
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And fight and die is death destroying death;"
III,II,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Where fearing dying pays death servile breath."
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"My father hath a power; inquire of him"
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"And learn to make a body of a limb."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"To change blows with thee for our day of doom."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"This ague fit of fear is over-blown;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"An easy task it is to win our own."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour."
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Men judge by the complexion of the sky"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"The state and inclination of the day:"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"So may you by my dull and heavy eye,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say."
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"I play the torturer, by small and small"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"And all your northern castles yielded up,"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"And all your southern gentlemen in arms"
III,II,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Upon his party."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Thou hast said enough."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Of that sweet way I was in to despair!"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"What say you now? what comfort have we now?"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"That bids me be of comfort any more."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"That power I have, discharge; and let them go"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"For I have none: let no man speak again"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"To alter this, for counsel is but vain."
III,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"My liege, one word."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"He does me double wrong"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue."
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"Discharge my followers: let them hence away,"
III,II,KING RICHARD II,"From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"So that by this intelligence we learn"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With some few private friends upon this coast."
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The news is very fair and good, my lord:"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Richard not far from hence hath hid his head."
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"It would beseem the Lord Northumberland"
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day"
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"When such a sacred king should hide his head."
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Your grace mistakes; only to be brief"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Left I his title out."
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"The time hath been,"
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Would you have been so brief with him, he would"
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,"
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"For taking so the head, your whole head's length."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Mistake not, uncle, further than you should."
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Take not, good cousin, further than you should."
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Against their will. But who comes here?"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?"
III,III,HENRY PERCY,"The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,"
III,III,HENRY PERCY,"Against thy entrance."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Royally!"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Why, it contains no king?"
III,III,HENRY PERCY,"Yes, my good lord,"
III,III,HENRY PERCY,"It doth contain a king; King Richard lies"
III,III,HENRY PERCY,"Within the limits of yon lime and stone:"
III,III,HENRY PERCY,"And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,"
III,III,HENRY PERCY,"Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman"
III,III,HENRY PERCY,"Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn."
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Noble lords,"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Henry Bolingbroke"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And sends allegiance and true faith of heart"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To his most royal person, hither come"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Provided that my banishment repeal'd"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And lands restored again be freely granted:"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"If not, I'll use the advantage of my power"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My stooping duty tenderly shall show."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Go, signify as much, while here we march"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Upon the grassy carpet of this plain."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That from this castle's tatter'd battlements"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Our fair appointments may be well perused."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Methinks King Richard and myself should meet"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With no less terror than the elements"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of fire and water, when their thundering shock"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My waters; on the earth, and not on him."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"March on, and mark King Richard how he looks."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As doth the blushing discontented sun"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"From out the fiery portal of the east,"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"When he perceives the envious clouds are bent"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To dim his glory and to stain the track"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of his bright passage to the occident."
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,"
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth"
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,"
III,III,DUKE OF YORK,"That any harm should stain so fair a show!"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"We are amazed; and thus long have we stood"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And if we be, how dare thy joints forget"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"To pay their awful duty to our presence?"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"If we be not, show us the hand of God"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"For well we know, no hand of blood and bone"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And though you think that all, as you have done,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Have torn their souls by turning them from us,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And we are barren and bereft of friends;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Your children yet unborn and unbegot,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"That lift your vassal hands against my head"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And threat the glory of my precious crown."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"That every stride he makes upon my land"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Is dangerous treason: he is come to open"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"The purple testament of bleeding war;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Shall ill become the flower of England's face,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"To scarlet indignation and bedew"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood."
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The king of heaven forbid our lord the king"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Should so with civil and uncivil arms"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And by the honourable tomb he swears,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And by the royalties of both your bloods,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Currents that spring from one most gracious head,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And by the worth and honour of himself,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Comprising all that may be sworn or said,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"His coming hither hath no further scope"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Than for his lineal royalties and to beg"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which on thy royal party granted once,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"His glittering arms he will commend to rust,"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To faithful service of your majesty."
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Northumberland, say thus the king returns:"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"His noble cousin is right welcome hither;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And all the number of his fair demands"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"With all the gracious utterance thou hast"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"To look so poorly and to speak so fair?"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Shall we call back Northumberland, and send"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Defiance to the traitor, and so die?"
III,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words"
III,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"That laid the sentence of dread banishment"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"On yon proud man, should take it off again"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"With words of sooth! O that I were as great"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"As is my grief, or lesser than my name!"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Or that I could forget what I have been,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Or not remember what I must be now!"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me."
III,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"What must the king do now? must he submit?"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"The king shall do it: must he be deposed?"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"The king shall be contented: must he lose"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"My figured goblets for a dish of wood,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"My subjects for a pair of carved saints"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And my large kingdom for a little grave,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"A little little grave, an obscure grave;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And buried once, why not upon my head?"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"We'll make foul weather with despised tears;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And make a dearth in this revolting land."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"And make some pretty match with shedding tears?"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"As thus, to drop them still upon one place,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Till they have fretted us a pair of graves"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"I talk but idly, and you laugh at me."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay."
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord, in the base court he doth attend"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To speak with you; may it please you to come down."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Wanting the manage of unruly jades."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"To come at traitors' calls and do them grace."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"In the base court? Come down? Down, court!"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"down, king!"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"For night-owls shriek where mounting larks"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"should sing."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What says his majesty?"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Sorrow and grief of heart"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man"
III,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yet he is come."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Stand all apart,"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And show fair duty to his majesty."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious lord,--"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"To make the base earth proud with kissing it:"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Me rather had my heart might feel your love"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Thus high at least, although your knee be low."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious lord, I come but for mine own."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all."
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As my true service shall deserve your love."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"That know the strong'st and surest way to get."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Tears show their love, but want their remedies."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Cousin, I am too young to be your father,"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Though you are old enough to be my heir."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;"
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"For do we must what force will have us do."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?"
III,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Yea, my good lord."
III,III,KING RICHARD II,"Then I must not say no."
III,IV,QUEEN,"What sport shall we devise here in this garden,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"To drive away the heavy thought of care?"
III,IV,Lady,"Madam, we'll play at bowls."
III,IV,QUEEN,"'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"And that my fortune rubs against the bias."
III,IV,Lady,"Madam, we'll dance."
III,IV,QUEEN,"My legs can keep no measure in delight,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport."
III,IV,Lady,"Madam, we'll tell tales."
III,IV,QUEEN,"Of sorrow or of joy?"
III,IV,Lady,"Of either, madam."
III,IV,QUEEN,"Of neither, girl:"
III,IV,QUEEN,"For of joy, being altogether wanting,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"It doth remember me the more of sorrow;"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Or if of grief, being altogether had,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:"
III,IV,QUEEN,"For what I have I need not to repeat;"
III,IV,QUEEN,"And what I want it boots not to complain."
III,IV,Lady,"Madam, I'll sing."
III,IV,QUEEN,"'Tis well that thou hast cause"
III,IV,QUEEN,"But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep."
III,IV,Lady,"I could weep, madam, would it do you good."
III,IV,QUEEN,"And I could sing, would weeping do me good,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"And never borrow any tear of thee."
III,IV,QUEEN,"But stay, here come the gardeners:"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Let's step into the shadow of these trees."
III,IV,QUEEN,"My wretchedness unto a row of pins,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"They'll talk of state; for every one doth so"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Against a change; woe is forerun with woe."
III,IV,Gardener,"Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,"
III,IV,Gardener,"Which, like unruly children, make their sire"
III,IV,Gardener,"Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:"
III,IV,Gardener,"Give some supportance to the bending twigs."
III,IV,Gardener,"Go thou, and like an executioner,"
III,IV,Gardener,"Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,"
III,IV,Gardener,"That look too lofty in our commonwealth:"
III,IV,Gardener,"All must be even in our government."
III,IV,Gardener,"You thus employ'd, I will go root away"
III,IV,Gardener,"The noisome weeds, which without profit suck"
III,IV,Gardener,"The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers."
III,IV,Servant,"Why should we in the compass of a pale"
III,IV,Servant,"Keep law and form and due proportion,"
III,IV,Servant,"Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,"
III,IV,Servant,"When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,"
III,IV,Servant,"Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,"
III,IV,Servant,"Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,"
III,IV,Servant,"Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs"
III,IV,Servant,"Swarming with caterpillars?"
III,IV,Gardener,"Hold thy peace:"
III,IV,Gardener,"He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring"
III,IV,Gardener,"Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:"
III,IV,Gardener,"The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,"
III,IV,Gardener,"That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,"
III,IV,Gardener,"Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,"
III,IV,Gardener,"I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green."
III,IV,Servant,"What, are they dead?"
III,IV,Gardener,"They are; and Bolingbroke"
III,IV,Gardener,"Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it"
III,IV,Gardener,"That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land"
III,IV,Gardener,"As we this garden! We at time of year"
III,IV,Gardener,"Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,"
III,IV,Gardener,"Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,"
III,IV,Gardener,"With too much riches it confound itself:"
III,IV,Gardener,"Had he done so to great and growing men,"
III,IV,Gardener,"They might have lived to bear and he to taste"
III,IV,Gardener,"Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches"
III,IV,Gardener,"We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:"
III,IV,Gardener,"Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,"
III,IV,Gardener,"Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down."
III,IV,Servant,"What, think you then the king shall be deposed?"
III,IV,Gardener,"Depress'd he is already, and deposed"
III,IV,Gardener,"'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night"
III,IV,Gardener,"To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,"
III,IV,Gardener,"That tell black tidings."
III,IV,QUEEN,"O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?"
III,IV,QUEEN,"What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee"
III,IV,QUEEN,"To make a second fall of cursed man?"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch."
III,IV,Gardener,"Pardon me, madam: little joy have I"
III,IV,Gardener,"To breathe this news; yet what I say is true."
III,IV,Gardener,"King Richard, he is in the mighty hold"
III,IV,Gardener,"Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:"
III,IV,Gardener,"In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,"
III,IV,Gardener,"And some few vanities that make him light;"
III,IV,Gardener,"But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,"
III,IV,Gardener,"Besides himself, are all the English peers,"
III,IV,Gardener,"And with that odds he weighs King Richard down."
III,IV,Gardener,"Post you to London, and you will find it so;"
III,IV,Gardener,"I speak no more than every one doth know."
III,IV,QUEEN,"Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Doth not thy embassage belong to me,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st"
III,IV,QUEEN,"To serve me last, that I may longest keep"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"To meet at London London's king in woe."
III,IV,QUEEN,"What, was I born to this, that my sad look"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,"
III,IV,QUEEN,"Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow."
III,IV,GARDENER,"Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,"
III,IV,GARDENER,"I would my skill were subject to thy curse."
III,IV,GARDENER,"Here did she fall a tear; here in this place"
III,IV,GARDENER,"I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:"
III,IV,GARDENER,"Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,"
III,IV,GARDENER,"In the remembrance of a weeping queen."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Call forth Bagot."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The bloody office of his timeless end."
IV,I,BAGOT,"Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man."
IV,I,BAGOT,"My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue"
IV,I,BAGOT,"Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd."
IV,I,BAGOT,"In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,"
IV,I,BAGOT,"I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,"
IV,I,BAGOT,"That reacheth from the restful English court"
IV,I,BAGOT,"As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'"
IV,I,BAGOT,"Amongst much other talk, that very time,"
IV,I,BAGOT,"I heard you say that you had rather refuse"
IV,I,BAGOT,"The offer of an hundred thousand crowns"
IV,I,BAGOT,"Than Bolingbroke's return to England;"
IV,I,BAGOT,"Adding withal how blest this land would be"
IV,I,BAGOT,"In this your cousin's death."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Princes and noble lords,"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"What answer shall I make to this base man?"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"On equal terms to give him chastisement?"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"With the attainder of his slanderous lips."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"There is my gage, the manual seal of death,"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"And will maintain what thou hast said is false"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"In thy heart-blood, though being all too base"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"To stain the temper of my knightly sword."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Excepting one, I would he were the best"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"In all this presence that hath moved me so."
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"If that thy valour stand on sympathy,"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death."
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"Where it was forged, with my rapier's point."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day."
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"Now by my soul, I would it were this hour."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this."
IV,I,HENRY PERCY,"Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true"
IV,I,HENRY PERCY,"In this appeal as thou art all unjust;"
IV,I,HENRY PERCY,"And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,"
IV,I,HENRY PERCY,"To prove it on thee to the extremest point"
IV,I,HENRY PERCY,"Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"An if I do not, may my hands rot off"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"And never brandish more revengeful steel"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Over the glittering helmet of my foe!"
IV,I,Lord,"I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;"
IV,I,Lord,"And spur thee on with full as many lies"
IV,I,Lord,"As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear"
IV,I,Lord,"From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;"
IV,I,Lord,"Engage it to the trial, if thou darest."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"I have a thousand spirits in one breast,"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"To answer twenty thousand such as you."
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well"
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"The very time Aumerle and you did talk."
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"'Tis very true: you were in presence then;"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"And you can witness with me this is true."
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true."
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"Surrey, thou liest."
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"Dishonourable boy!"
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,"
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"That it shall render vengeance and revenge"
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie"
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:"
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;"
IV,I,DUKE OF SURREY,"Engage it to the trial, if thou darest."
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"To tie thee to my strong correction."
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"As I intend to thrive in this new world,"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men"
IV,I,LORD FITZWATER,"To execute the noble duke at Calais."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Some honest Christian trust me with a gage"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"These differences shall all rest under gage"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And, though mine enemy, restored again"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"That honourable day shall ne'er be seen."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And toil'd with works of war, retired himself"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"To Italy; and there at Venice gave"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"His body to that pleasant country's earth,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Under whose colours he had fought so long."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"As surely as I live, my lord."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Your differences shall all rest under gage"

IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"To the possession of thy royal hand:"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Ascend his throne, descending now from him;"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"And long live Henry, fourth of that name!"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Marry. God forbid!"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Worst in this royal presence may I speak,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Would God that any in this noble presence"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Were enough noble to be upright judge"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"What subject can give sentence on his king?"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Although apparent guilt be seen in them;"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And shall the figure of God's majesty,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"His captain, steward, deputy-elect,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Anointed, crowned, planted many years,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Be judged by subject and inferior breath,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"That in a Christian climate souls refined"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And if you crown him, let me prophesy:"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"The blood of English shall manure the ground,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And future ages groan for this foul act;"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"O, if you raise this house against this house,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"It will the woefullest division prove"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"That ever fell upon this cursed earth."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,"
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Of capital treason we arrest you here."
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To keep him safely till his day of trial."
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Fetch hither Richard, that in common view"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"He may surrender; so we shall proceed"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Without suspicion."
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"I will be his conduct."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Lords, you that here are under our arrest,"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Procure your sureties for your days of answer."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Little are we beholding to your love,"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And little look'd for at your helping hands."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Alack, why am I sent for to a king,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Before I have shook off the regal thoughts"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"To this submission. Yet I well remember"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"The favours of these men: were they not mine?"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"God save the king! Will no man say amen?"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"God save the king! although I be not he;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"To do what service am I sent for hither?"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"To do that office of thine own good will"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"Which tired majesty did make thee offer,"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"The resignation of thy state and crown"
IV,I,DUKE OF YORK,"To Henry Bolingbroke."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Here cousin:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"On this side my hand, and on that side yours."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Now is this golden crown like a deep well"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"That owes two buckets, filling one another,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"The emptier ever dancing in the air,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"The other down, unseen and full of water:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"That bucket down and full of tears am I,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I thought you had been willing to resign."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"You may my glories and my state depose,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"But not my griefs; still am I king of those."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Part of your cares you give me with your crown."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"My care is loss of care, by old care done;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Your care is gain of care, by new care won:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"The cares I give I have, though given away;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Are you contented to resign the crown?"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Therefore no no, for I resign to thee."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Now mark me, how I will undo myself;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"I give this heavy weight from off my head"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"With mine own tears I wash away my balm,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"With mine own hands I give away my crown,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"With mine own breath release all duty's rites:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"All pomp and majesty I do forswear;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"My manors, rents, revenues I forego;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And send him many years of sunshine days!"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"What more remains?"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"No more, but that you read"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"These accusations and these grievous crimes"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Committed by your person and your followers"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Against the state and profit of this land;"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That, by confessing them, the souls of men"
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"May deem that you are worthily deposed."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Must I do so? and must I ravel out"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"If thy offences were upon record,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"There shouldst thou find one heinous article,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Containing the deposing of a king"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And water cannot wash away your sin."
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And yet salt water blinds them not so much"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"But they can see a sort of traitors here."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"I find myself a traitor with the rest;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"For I have given here my soul's consent"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"To undeck the pompous body of a king;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant."
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord,--"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"No, not that name was given me at the font,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"That I have worn so many winters out,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And know not now what name to call myself!"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"O that I were a mockery king of snow,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"To melt myself away in water-drops!"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"An if my word be sterling yet in England,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Let it command a mirror hither straight,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"That it may show me what a face I have,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Since it is bankrupt of his majesty."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass."
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland."
IV,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The commons will not then be satisfied."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"When I do see the very book indeed"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Give me the glass, and therein will I read."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"So many blows upon this face of mine,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Like to my followers in prosperity,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"That every day under his household roof"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Was this the face that faced so many follies,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"A brittle glory shineth in this face:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"As brittle as the glory is the face;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The shadow or your face."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Say that again."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And these external manners of laments"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Are merely shadows to the unseen grief"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"That swells with silence in the tortured soul;"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"For thy great bounty, that not only givest"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Me cause to wail but teachest me the way"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And then be gone and trouble you no more."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Shall I obtain it?"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Name it, fair cousin."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"For when I was a king, my flatterers"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Were then but subjects; being now a subject,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"I have a king here to my flatterer."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Being so great, I have no need to beg."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Yet ask."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"And shall I have?"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"You shall."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Then give me leave to go."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Whither?"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"Whither you will, so I were from your sights."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Go, some of you convey him to the Tower."
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,"
IV,I,KING RICHARD II,"That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall."
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"On Wednesday next we solemnly set down"
IV,I,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves."
IV,I,Abbot,"A woeful pageant have we here beheld."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"The woe's to come; the children yet unborn."
IV,I,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn."
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"You holy clergymen, is there no plot"
IV,I,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?"
IV,I,Abbot,"My lord,"
IV,I,Abbot,"Before I freely speak my mind herein,"
IV,I,Abbot,"You shall not only take the sacrament"
IV,I,Abbot,"To bury mine intents, but also to effect"
IV,I,Abbot,"Whatever I shall happen to devise."
IV,I,Abbot,"I see your brows are full of discontent,"
IV,I,Abbot,"Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:"
IV,I,Abbot,"Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay"
IV,I,Abbot,"A plot shall show us all a merry day."
V,I,QUEEN,"This way the king will come; this is the way"
V,I,QUEEN,"To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,"
V,I,QUEEN,"To whose flint bosom my condemned lord"
V,I,QUEEN,"Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:"
V,I,QUEEN,"Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth"
V,I,QUEEN,"Have any resting for her true king's queen."
V,I,QUEEN,"But soft, but see, or rather do not see,"
V,I,QUEEN,"My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,"
V,I,QUEEN,"That you in pity may dissolve to dew,"
V,I,QUEEN,"And wash him fresh again with true-love tears."
V,I,QUEEN,"Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,"
V,I,QUEEN,"Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,"
V,I,QUEEN,"And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,"
V,I,QUEEN,"Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,"
V,I,QUEEN,"When triumph is become an alehouse guest?"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"To think our former state a happy dream;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"From which awaked, the truth of what we are"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"To grim Necessity, and he and I"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And cloister thee in some religious house:"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Which our profane hours here have stricken down."
V,I,QUEEN,"What, is my Richard both in shape and mind"
V,I,QUEEN,"Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed"
V,I,QUEEN,"Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?"
V,I,QUEEN,"The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,"
V,I,QUEEN,"And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage"
V,I,QUEEN,"To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,"
V,I,QUEEN,"Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,"
V,I,QUEEN,"And fawn on rage with base humility,"
V,I,QUEEN,"Which art a lion and a king of beasts?"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"I had been still a happy king of men."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"As from my death-bed, thy last living leave."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"With good old folks and let them tell thee tales"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Of woeful ages long ago betid;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Tell thou the lamentable tale of me"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And send the hearers weeping to their beds:"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"For why, the senseless brands will sympathize"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"The heavy accent of thy moving tongue"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And in compassion weep the fire out;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"For the deposing of a rightful king."
V,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:"
V,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower."
V,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;"
V,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"With all swift speed you must away to France."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"The time shall not be many hours of age"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"More than it is ere foul sin gathering head"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Though he divide the realm and give thee half,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"It is too little, helping him to all;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Being ne'er so little urged, another way"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"The love of wicked men converts to fear;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"To worthy danger and deserved death."
V,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My guilt be on my head, and there an end."
V,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And then betwixt me and my married wife."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"She came adorned hither like sweet May,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day."
V,I,QUEEN,"And must we be divided? must we part?"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart."
V,I,QUEEN,"Banish us both and send the king with me."
V,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That were some love but little policy."
V,I,QUEEN,"Then whither he goes, thither let me go."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"So two, together weeping, make one woe."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Better far off than near, be ne'er the near."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans."
V,I,QUEEN,"So longest way shall have the longest moans."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"And piece the way out with a heavy heart."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart."
V,I,QUEEN,"Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part"
V,I,QUEEN,"To take on me to keep and kill thy heart."
V,I,QUEEN,"So, now I have mine own again, be gone,"
V,I,QUEEN,"That I might strive to kill it with a groan."
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"We make woe wanton with this fond delay:"
V,I,KING RICHARD II,"Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"When weeping made you break the story off,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"of our two cousins coming into London."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Where did I leave?"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"At that sad stop, my lord,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"With slow but stately pace kept on his course,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Bolingbroke!'"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"You would have thought the very windows spake,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"So many greedy looks of young and old"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Through casements darted their desiring eyes"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Upon his visage, and that all the walls"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"With painted imagery had said at once"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"As in a theatre, the eyes of men,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Are idly bent on him that enters next,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Thinking his prattle to be tedious;"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"His face still combating with tears and smiles,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"The badges of his grief and patience,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And barbarism itself have pitied him."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"But heaven hath a hand in these events,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"To whose high will we bound our calm contents."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Whose state and honour I for aye allow."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Here comes my son Aumerle."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Aumerle that was;"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"But that is lost for being Richard's friend,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"I am in parliament pledge for his truth"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And lasting fealty to the new-made king."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Welcome, my son: who are the violets now"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That strew the green lap of the new come spring?"
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:"
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"God knows I had as lief be none as one."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?"
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"For aught I know, my lord, they do."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"You will be there, I know."
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"If God prevent not, I purpose so."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing."
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"My lord, 'tis nothing."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"No matter, then, who see it;"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"I will be satisfied; let me see the writing."
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"I do beseech your grace to pardon me:"
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"It is a matter of small consequence,"
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Which for some reasons I would not have seen."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"I fear, I fear,--"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"What should you fear?"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Boy, let me see the writing."
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"What is the matter, my lord?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Ho! who is within there?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Saddle my horse."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"God for his mercy, what treachery is here!"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Why, what is it, my lord?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"I will appeach the villain."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"What is the matter?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Peace, foolish woman."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle."
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Good mother, be content; it is no more"
V,II,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Than my poor life must answer."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thy life answer!"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Bring me my boots: I will unto the king."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Hence, villain! never more come in my sight."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Give me my boots, I say."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Why, York, what wilt thou do?"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Have we more sons? or are we like to have?"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And rob me of a happy mother's name?"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Thou fond mad woman,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"And interchangeably set down their hands,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"To kill the king at Oxford."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"He shall be none;"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,"
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"I would appeach him."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Hadst thou groan'd for him"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That I have been disloyal to thy bed,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And that he is a bastard, not thy son:"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"He is as like thee as a man may be,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Not like to me, or any of my kin,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And yet I love him."
V,II,DUKE OF YORK,"Make way, unruly woman!"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Spur post, and get before him to the king,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee."
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I'll not be long behind; though I be old,"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And never will I rise up from the ground"
V,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"'Tis full three months since I did see him last;"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"If any plague hang over us, 'tis he."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I would to God, my lords, he might be found:"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With unrestrained loose companions,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Takes on the point of honour to support"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"So dissolute a crew."
V,III,HENRY PERCY,"My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,"
V,III,HENRY PERCY,"And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And what said the gallant?"
V,III,HENRY PERCY,"His answer was, he would unto the stews,"
V,III,HENRY PERCY,"And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,"
V,III,HENRY PERCY,"And wear it as a favour; and with that"
V,III,HENRY PERCY,"He would unhorse the lustiest challenger."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As dissolute as desperate; yet through both"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"May happily bring forth. But who comes here?"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Where is the king?"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What means our cousin, that he stares and looks"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"So wildly?"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"To have some conference with your grace alone."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What is the matter with our cousin now?"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"For ever may my knees grow to the earth,"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Intended or committed was this fault?"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To win thy after-love I pardon thee."
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Then give me leave that I may turn the key,"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"That no man enter till my tale be done."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Have thy desire."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Villain, I'll make thee safe."
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Open the door, or I will break it open."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What is the matter, uncle? speak;"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That we may arm us to encounter it."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"The treason that my haste forbids me show."
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"I do repent me; read not my name there"
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"My heart is not confederate with my hand."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"A serpent that will sting thee to the heart."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O loyal father of a treacherous son!"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"From when this stream through muddy passages"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Hath held his current and defiled himself!"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Thy overflow of good converts to bad,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And thy abundant goodness shall excuse"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"This deadly blot in thy digressing son."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"The traitor lives, the true man's put to death."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"let me in."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Speak with me, pity me, open the door."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"A beggar begs that never begg'd before."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I know she is come to pray for your foul sin."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"More sins for this forgiveness prosper may."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"This let alone will all the rest confound."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Love loving not itself none other can."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?"
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Rise up, good aunt."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Not yet, I thee beseech:"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"For ever will I walk upon my knees,"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And never see day that the happy sees,"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy."
V,III,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Against them both my true joints bended be."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"He prays but faintly and would be denied;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"We pray with heart and soul and all beside:"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ours of true zeal and deep integrity."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That mercy which true prayer ought to have."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Good aunt, stand up."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I never long'd to hear a word till now;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"The word is short, but not so short as sweet;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet."
V,III,DUKE OF YORK,"Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That set'st the word itself against the word!"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"The chopping French we do not understand."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Good aunt, stand up."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I do not sue to stand;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Pardon is all the suit I have in hand."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I pardon him, as God shall pardon me."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,"
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"But makes one pardon strong."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With all my heart"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I pardon him."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"A god on earth thou art."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With all the rest of that consorted crew,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Good uncle, help to order several powers"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"They shall not live within this world, I swear,"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But I will have them, if I once know where."
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:"
V,III,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true."
V,III,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new."
V,IV,EXTON,"Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,"
V,IV,EXTON,"'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'"
V,IV,EXTON,"Was it not so?"
V,IV,Servant,"These were his very words."
V,IV,EXTON,"'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,"
V,IV,EXTON,"And urged it twice together, did he not?"
V,IV,Servant,"He did."
V,IV,EXTON,"And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,"
V,IV,EXTON,"And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'"
V,IV,EXTON,"That would divorce this terror from my heart;'"
V,IV,EXTON,"Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:"
V,IV,EXTON,"I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"I have been studying how I may compare"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"This prison where I live unto the world:"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And for because the world is populous"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And here is not a creature but myself,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"My soul the father; and these two beget"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"A generation of still-breeding thoughts,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And these same thoughts people this little world,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"In humours like the people of this world,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"For no thought is contented. The better sort,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"With scruples and do set the word itself"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Against the word:"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"'It is as hard to come as for a camel"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"May tear a passage through the flinty ribs"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And, for they cannot, die in their own pride."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"That many have and others must sit there;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And in this thought they find a kind of ease,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Bearing their own misfortunes on the back"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Of such as have before endured the like."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Thus play I in one person many people,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And none contented: sometimes am I king;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And so I am: then crushing penury"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Persuades me I was better when a king;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Then am I king'd again: and by and by"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Nor I nor any man that but man is"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"With being nothing. Music do I hear?"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"When time is broke and no proportion kept!"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"So is it in the music of men's lives."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And here have I the daintiness of ear"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"But for the concord of my state and time"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Had not an ear to hear my true time broke."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"For now hath time made me his numbering clock:"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"This music mads me; let it sound no more;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"For though it have holp madmen to their wits,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"In me it seems it will make wise men mad."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world."
V,V,Groom,"Hail, royal prince!"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Thanks, noble peer;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"What art thou? and how comest thou hither,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Where no man never comes but that sad dog"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"That brings me food to make misfortune live?"
V,V,Groom,"I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,"
V,V,Groom,"When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,"
V,V,Groom,"With much ado at length have gotten leave"
V,V,Groom,"To look upon my sometimes royal master's face."
V,V,Groom,"O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld"
V,V,Groom,"In London streets, that coronation-day,"
V,V,Groom,"When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,"
V,V,Groom,"That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,"
V,V,Groom,"That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"How went he under him?"
V,V,Groom,"So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"This hand hath made him proud with clapping him."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Of that proud man that did usurp his back?"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Since thou, created to be awed by man,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke."
V,V,Keeper,"Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away."
V,V,Groom,"What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say."
V,V,Keeper,"My lord, will't please you to fall to?"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do."
V,V,Keeper,"My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who"
V,V,Keeper,"lately came from the king, commands the contrary."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Patience is stale, and I am weary of it."
V,V,Keeper,"Help, help, help!"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"How now! what means death in this rude assault?"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Go thou, and fill another room in hell."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land."
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;"
V,V,KING RICHARD II,"Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die."
V,V,EXTON,"As full of valour as of royal blood:"
V,V,EXTON,"Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!"
V,V,EXTON,"For now the devil, that told me I did well,"
V,V,EXTON,"Says that this deed is chronicled in hell."
V,V,EXTON,"This dead king to the living king I'll bear"
V,V,EXTON,"Take hence the rest, and give them burial here."
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Is that the rebels have consumed with fire"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not."
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Welcome, my lord what is the news?"
V,VI,NORTHUMBERLAND,"First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness."
V,VI,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The next news is, I have to London sent"

V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Right noble is thy merit, well I wot."
V,VI,HENRY PERCY,"The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,"
V,VI,HENRY PERCY,"With clog of conscience and sour melancholy"
V,VI,HENRY PERCY,"Hath yielded up his body to the grave;"
V,VI,HENRY PERCY,"But here is Carlisle living, to abide"
V,VI,HENRY PERCY,"Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride."
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Carlisle, this is your doom:"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"High sparks of honour in thee have I seen."
V,VI,EXTON,"Great king, within this coffin I present"
V,VI,EXTON,"Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies"
V,VI,EXTON,"The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,"

V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"A deed of slander with thy fatal hand"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Upon my head and all this famous land."
V,VI,EXTON,"From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed."
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"They love not poison that do poison need,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I hate the murderer, love him murdered."
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But neither my good word nor princely favour:"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With Cain go wander through shades of night,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And never show thy head by day nor light."
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And put on sullen black incontinent:"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"March sadly after; grace my mournings here;"
V,VI,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In weeping after this untimely bier."
