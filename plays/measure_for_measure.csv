I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Escalus."
I,I,ESCALUS,"My lord."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of government the properties to unfold,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Since I am put to know that your own science"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"My strength can give you: then no more remains,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And let them work. The nature of our people,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Our city's institutions, and the terms"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For common justice, you're as pregnant in"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As art and practise hath enriched any"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That we remember. There is our commission,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I say, bid come before us Angelo."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What figure of us think you he will bear?"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For you must know, we have with special soul"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Elected him our absence to supply,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And given his deputation all the organs"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of our own power: what think you of it?"
I,I,ESCALUS,"If any in Vienna be of worth"
I,I,ESCALUS,"To undergo such ample grace and honour,"
I,I,ESCALUS,"It is Lord Angelo."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Look where he comes."
I,I,ANGELO,"Always obedient to your grace's will,"
I,I,ANGELO,"I come to know your pleasure."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Angelo,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"There is a kind of character in thy life,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That to the observer doth thy history"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Are not thine own so proper as to waste"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The smallest scruple of her excellence"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Herself the glory of a creditor,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To one that can my part in him advertise;"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hold therefore, Angelo:--"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In our remove be thou at full ourself;"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Mortality and mercy in Vienna"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Though first in question, is thy secondary."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Take thy commission."
I,I,ANGELO,"Now, good my lord,"
I,I,ANGELO,"Let there be some more test made of my metal,"
I,I,ANGELO,"Before so noble and so great a figure"
I,I,ANGELO,"Be stamp'd upon it."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"No more evasion:"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Our haste from hence is of so quick condition"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As time and our concernings shall importune,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How it goes with us, and do look to know"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To the hopeful execution do I leave you"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of your commissions."
I,I,ANGELO,"Yet give leave, my lord,"
I,I,ANGELO,"That we may bring you something on the way."
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"My haste may not admit it;"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"With any scruple; your scope is as mine own"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"So to enforce or qualify the laws"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I'll privily away. I love the people,"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But do not like to stage me to their eyes:"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Through it do well, I do not relish well"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Their loud applause and Aves vehement;"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nor do I think the man of safe discretion"
I,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That does affect it. Once more, fare you well."
I,I,ANGELO,"The heavens give safety to your purposes!"
I,I,ESCALUS,"Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!"
I,I,DUKE,"I thank you. Fare you well."
I,I,ESCALUS,"I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave"
I,I,ESCALUS,"To have free speech with you; and it concerns me"
I,I,ESCALUS,"To look into the bottom of my place:"
I,I,ESCALUS,"A power I have, but of what strength and nature"
I,I,ESCALUS,"I am not yet instructed."
I,I,ANGELO,"'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,"
I,I,ANGELO,"And we may soon our satisfaction have"
I,I,ANGELO,"Touching that point."
I,I,ESCALUS,"I'll wait upon your honour."
I,II,LUCIO,"If the duke with the other dukes come not to"
I,II,LUCIO,"composition with the King of Hungary, why then all"
I,II,LUCIO,"the dukes fall upon the king."
I,II,First Gentleman,"Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of"
I,II,First Gentleman,"Hungary's!"
I,II,Second Gentleman,"Amen."
I,II,LUCIO,"Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that"
I,II,LUCIO,"went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped"
I,II,LUCIO,"one out of the table."
I,II,Second Gentleman,"'Thou shalt not steal'?"
I,II,LUCIO,"Ay, that he razed."
I,II,First Gentleman,"Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and"
I,II,First Gentleman,"all the rest from their functions: they put forth"
I,II,First Gentleman,"to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in"
I,II,First Gentleman,"the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition"
I,II,First Gentleman,"well that prays for peace."
I,II,Second Gentleman,"I never heard any soldier dislike it."
I,II,LUCIO,"I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where"
I,II,LUCIO,"grace was said."
I,II,Second Gentleman,"No? a dozen times at least."
I,II,First Gentleman,"What, in metre?"
I,II,LUCIO,"In any proportion or in any language."
I,II,First Gentleman,"I think, or in any religion."
I,II,LUCIO,"Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all"
I,II,LUCIO,"controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a"
I,II,LUCIO,"wicked villain, despite of all grace."
I,II,First Gentleman,"Well, there went but a pair of shears between us."
I,II,LUCIO,"I grant; as there may between the lists and the"
I,II,LUCIO,"velvet. Thou art the list."
I,II,First Gentleman,"And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt"
I,II,First Gentleman,"a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief"
I,II,First Gentleman,"be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou"
I,II,First Gentleman,"art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak"
I,II,First Gentleman,"feelingly now?"
I,II,LUCIO,"I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful"
I,II,LUCIO,"feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own"
I,II,LUCIO,"confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I"
I,II,LUCIO,"live, forget to drink after thee."
I,II,First Gentleman,"I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?"
I,II,Second Gentleman,"Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free."
I,II,LUCIO,"Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I"
I,II,LUCIO,"have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--"
I,II,Second Gentleman,"To what, I pray?"
I,II,LUCIO,"Judge."
I,II,Second Gentleman,"To three thousand dolours a year."
I,II,First Gentleman,"Ay, and more."
I,II,LUCIO,"A French crown more."
I,II,First Gentleman,"Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou"
I,II,First Gentleman,"art full of error; I am sound."
I,II,LUCIO,"Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as"
I,II,LUCIO,"things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;"
I,II,LUCIO,"impiety has made a feast of thee."
I,II,First Gentleman,"How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"to prison was worth five thousand of you all."
I,II,Second Gentleman,"Who's that, I pray thee?"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio."
I,II,First Gentleman,"Claudio to prison? 'tis not so."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"him carried away; and, which is more, within these"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"three days his head to be chopped off."
I,II,LUCIO,"But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so."
I,II,LUCIO,"Art thou sure of this?"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Julietta with child."
I,II,LUCIO,"Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two"
I,II,LUCIO,"hours since, and he was ever precise in"
I,II,LUCIO,"promise-keeping."
I,II,Second Gentleman,"Besides, you know, it draws something near to the"
I,II,Second Gentleman,"speech we had to such a purpose."
I,II,First Gentleman,"But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation."
I,II,LUCIO,"Away! let's go learn the truth of it."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"with the gallows and what with poverty, I am"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"custom-shrunk."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"How now! what's the news with you?"
I,II,POMPEY,"Yonder man is carried to prison."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Well; what has he done?"
I,II,POMPEY,"A woman."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"But what's his offence?"
I,II,POMPEY,"Groping for trouts in a peculiar river."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"What, is there a maid with child by him?"
I,II,POMPEY,"No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have"
I,II,POMPEY,"not heard of the proclamation, have you?"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"What proclamation, man?"
I,II,POMPEY,"All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"And what shall become of those in the city?"
I,II,POMPEY,"They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,"
I,II,POMPEY,"but that a wise burgher put in for them."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"pulled down?"
I,II,POMPEY,"To the ground, mistress."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!"
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"What shall become of me?"
I,II,POMPEY,"Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no"
I,II,POMPEY,"clients: though you change your place, you need not"
I,II,POMPEY,"change your trade; I'll be your tapster still."
I,II,POMPEY,"Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that"
I,II,POMPEY,"have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you"
I,II,POMPEY,"will be considered."
I,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw."
I,II,POMPEY,"Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to"
I,II,POMPEY,"prison; and there's Madam Juliet."
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Bear me to prison, where I am committed."
I,II,Provost,"I do it not in evil disposition,"
I,II,Provost,"But from Lord Angelo by special charge."
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Thus can the demigod Authority"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Make us pay down for our offence by weight"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just."
I,II,LUCIO,"Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"As surfeit is the father of much fast,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"So every scope by the immoderate use"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die."
I,II,LUCIO,"If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would"
I,II,LUCIO,"send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say"
I,II,LUCIO,"the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom"
I,II,LUCIO,"as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy"
I,II,LUCIO,"offence, Claudio?"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"What but to speak of would offend again."
I,II,LUCIO,"What, is't murder?"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"No."
I,II,LUCIO,"Lechery?"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Call it so."
I,II,Provost,"Away, sir! you must go."
I,II,CLAUDIO,"One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you."
I,II,LUCIO,"A hundred, if they'll do you any good."
I,II,LUCIO,"Is lechery so look'd after?"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"I got possession of Julietta's bed:"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"You know the lady; she is fast my wife,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Save that we do the denunciation lack"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Of outward order: this we came not to,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Only for propagation of a dower"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Remaining in the coffer of her friends,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"From whom we thought it meet to hide our love"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Till time had made them for us. But it chances"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"The stealth of our most mutual entertainment"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"With character too gross is writ on Juliet."
I,II,LUCIO,"With child, perhaps?"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Unhappily, even so."
I,II,CLAUDIO,"And the new deputy now for the duke--"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Or whether that the body public be"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"A horse whereon the governor doth ride,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Who, newly in the seat, that it may know"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Whether the tyranny be in his place,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Or in his emmence that fills it up,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"I stagger in:--but this new governor"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Awakes me all the enrolled penalties"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"And none of them been worn; and, for a name,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Now puts the drowsy and neglected act"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name."
I,II,LUCIO,"I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on"
I,II,LUCIO,"thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,"
I,II,LUCIO,"may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to"
I,II,LUCIO,"him."
I,II,CLAUDIO,"I have done so, but he's not to be found."
I,II,CLAUDIO,"I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"This day my sister should the cloister enter"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"And there receive her approbation:"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Acquaint her with the danger of my state:"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"I have great hope in that; for in her youth"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"There is a prone and speechless dialect,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"When she will play with reason and discourse,"
I,II,CLAUDIO,"And well she can persuade."
I,II,LUCIO,"I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the"
I,II,LUCIO,"like, which else would stand under grievous"
I,II,LUCIO,"imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I"
I,II,LUCIO,"would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a"
I,II,LUCIO,"game of tick-tack. I'll to her."
I,II,CLAUDIO,"I thank you, good friend Lucio."
I,II,LUCIO,"Within two hours."
I,II,CLAUDIO,"Come, officer, away!"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"No, holy father; throw away that thought;"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Believe not that the dribbling dart of love"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of burning youth."
I,III,FRIAR THOMAS,"May your grace speak of it?"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"My holy sir, none better knows than you"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How I have ever loved the life removed"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And held in idle price to haunt assemblies"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps."
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A man of stricture and firm abstinence,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"My absolute power and place here in Vienna,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And so it is received. Now, pious sir,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You will demand of me why I do this?"
I,III,FRIAR THOMAS,"Gladly, my lord."
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"We have strict statutes and most biting laws."
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Only to stick it in their children's sight"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For terror, not to use, in time the rod"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And liberty plucks justice by the nose;"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Goes all decorum."
I,III,FRIAR THOMAS,"It rested in your grace"
I,III,FRIAR THOMAS,"To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:"
I,III,FRIAR THOMAS,"And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd"
I,III,FRIAR THOMAS,"Than in Lord Angelo."
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I do fear, too dreadful:"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"When evil deeds have their permissive pass"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I have on Angelo imposed the office;"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And yet my nature never in the fight"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To do in slander. And to behold his sway,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Supply me with the habit and instruct me"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How I may formally in person bear me"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Like a true friar. More reasons for this action"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"At our more leisure shall I render you;"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That his blood flows, or that his appetite"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,"
I,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"If power change purpose, what our seemers be."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"And have you nuns no farther privileges?"
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"Are not these large enough?"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"But rather wishing a more strict restraint"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Who's that which calls?"
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,"
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"Turn you the key, and know his business of him;"
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn."
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men"
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"But in the presence of the prioress:"
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,"
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"Or, if you show your face, you must not speak."
I,IV,FRANCISCA,"He calls again; I pray you, answer him."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me"
I,IV,LUCIO,"As bring me to the sight of Isabella,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"A novice of this place and the fair sister"
I,IV,LUCIO,"To her unhappy brother Claudio?"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"The rather for I now must make you know"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"I am that Isabella and his sister."
I,IV,LUCIO,"Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Not to be weary with you, he's in prison."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Woe me! for what?"
I,IV,LUCIO,"For that which, if myself might be his judge,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"He should receive his punishment in thanks:"
I,IV,LUCIO,"He hath got his friend with child."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Sir, make me not your story."
I,IV,LUCIO,"It is true."
I,IV,LUCIO,"I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin"
I,IV,LUCIO,"With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:"
I,IV,LUCIO,"I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted."
I,IV,LUCIO,"By your renouncement an immortal spirit,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"And to be talk'd with in sincerity,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"As with a saint."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"You do blaspheme the good in mocking me."
I,IV,LUCIO,"Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Your brother and his lover have embraced:"
I,IV,LUCIO,"As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time"
I,IV,LUCIO,"That from the seedness the bare fallow brings"
I,IV,LUCIO,"To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Is she your cousin?"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"By vain though apt affection."
I,IV,LUCIO,"She it is."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"O, let him marry her."
I,IV,LUCIO,"This is the point."
I,IV,LUCIO,"The duke is very strangely gone from hence;"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"In hand and hope of action: but we do learn"
I,IV,LUCIO,"By those that know the very nerves of state,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"His givings-out were of an infinite distance"
I,IV,LUCIO,"From his true-meant design. Upon his place,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"And with full line of his authority,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Is very snow-broth; one who never feels"
I,IV,LUCIO,"The wanton stings and motions of the sense,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge"
I,IV,LUCIO,"With profits of the mind, study and fast."
I,IV,LUCIO,"He--to give fear to use and liberty,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Which have for long run by the hideous law,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Under whose heavy sense your brother's life"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;"
I,IV,LUCIO,"And follows close the rigour of the statute,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"To make him an example. All hope is gone,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer"
I,IV,LUCIO,"To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business"
I,IV,LUCIO,"'Twixt you and your poor brother."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Doth he so seek his life?"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Has censured him"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath"
I,IV,LUCIO,"A warrant for his execution."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Alas! what poor ability's in me"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"To do him good?"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Assay the power you have."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"My power? Alas, I doubt--"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Our doubts are traitors"
I,IV,LUCIO,"And make us lose the good we oft might win"
I,IV,LUCIO,"By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,"
I,IV,LUCIO,"All their petitions are as freely theirs"
I,IV,LUCIO,"As they themselves would owe them."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"I'll see what I can do."
I,IV,LUCIO,"But speedily."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"I will about it straight;"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"No longer staying but to give the mother"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Commend me to my brother: soon at night"
I,IV,ISABELLA,"I'll send him certain word of my success."
I,IV,LUCIO,"I take my leave of you."
I,IV,ISABELLA,"Good sir, adieu."
II,I,ANGELO,"We must not make a scarecrow of the law,"
II,I,ANGELO,"Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,"
II,I,ANGELO,"And let it keep one shape, till custom make it"
II,I,ANGELO,"Their perch and not their terror."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Ay, but yet"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Whom I would save, had a most noble father!"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Let but your honour know,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"That, in the working of your own affections,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Or that the resolute acting of your blood"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Whether you had not sometime in your life"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Err'd in this point which now you censure him,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"And pull'd the law upon you."
II,I,ANGELO,"'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,"
II,I,ANGELO,"Another thing to fall. I not deny,"
II,I,ANGELO,"The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,"
II,I,ANGELO,"May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two"
II,I,ANGELO,"Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,"
II,I,ANGELO,"That justice seizes: what know the laws"
II,I,ANGELO,"That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,"
II,I,ANGELO,"The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't"
II,I,ANGELO,"Because we see it; but what we do not see"
II,I,ANGELO,"We tread upon, and never think of it."
II,I,ANGELO,"You may not so extenuate his offence"
II,I,ANGELO,"For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,"
II,I,ANGELO,"When I, that censure him, do so offend,"
II,I,ANGELO,"Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,"
II,I,ANGELO,"And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Be it as your wisdom will."
II,I,ANGELO,"Where is the provost?"
II,I,Provost,"Here, if it like your honour."
II,I,ANGELO,"See that Claudio"
II,I,ANGELO,"Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:"
II,I,ANGELO,"Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;"
II,I,ANGELO,"For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:"
II,I,ESCALUS,"And some condemned for a fault alone."
II,I,ELBOW,"Come, bring them away: if these be good people in"
II,I,ELBOW,"a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in"
II,I,ELBOW,"common houses, I know no law: bring them away."
II,I,ANGELO,"How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?"
II,I,ELBOW,"If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's"
II,I,ELBOW,"constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon"
II,I,ELBOW,"justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good"
II,I,ELBOW,"honour two notorious benefactors."
II,I,ANGELO,"Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are"
II,I,ANGELO,"they not malefactors?"
II,I,ELBOW,"If it? please your honour, I know not well what they"
II,I,ELBOW,"are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure"
II,I,ELBOW,"of; and void of all profanation in the world that"
II,I,ELBOW,"good Christians ought to have."
II,I,ESCALUS,"This comes off well; here's a wise officer."
II,I,ANGELO,"Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your"
II,I,ANGELO,"name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?"
II,I,POMPEY,"He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow."
II,I,ANGELO,"What are you, sir?"
II,I,ELBOW,"He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that"
II,I,ELBOW,"serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they"
II,I,ELBOW,"say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she"
II,I,ELBOW,"professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too."
II,I,ESCALUS,"How know you that?"
II,I,ELBOW,"My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--"
II,I,ESCALUS,"How? thy wife?"
II,I,ELBOW,"Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Dost thou detest her therefore?"
II,I,ELBOW,"I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as"
II,I,ELBOW,"she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,"
II,I,ELBOW,"it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house."
II,I,ESCALUS,"How dost thou know that, constable?"
II,I,ELBOW,"Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman"
II,I,ELBOW,"cardinally given, might have been accused in"
II,I,ELBOW,"fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there."
II,I,ESCALUS,"By the woman's means?"
II,I,ELBOW,"Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she"
II,I,ELBOW,"spit in his face, so she defied him."
II,I,POMPEY,"Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so."
II,I,ELBOW,"Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable"
II,I,ELBOW,"man; prove it."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Do you hear how he misplaces?"
II,I,POMPEY,"Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,"
II,I,POMPEY,"saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;"
II,I,POMPEY,"sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very"
II,I,POMPEY,"distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a"
II,I,POMPEY,"dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen"
II,I,POMPEY,"such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very"
II,I,POMPEY,"good dishes,--"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir."
II,I,POMPEY,"No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in"
II,I,POMPEY,"the right: but to the point. As I say, this"
II,I,POMPEY,"Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and"
II,I,POMPEY,"being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for"
II,I,POMPEY,"prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,"
II,I,POMPEY,"Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the"
II,I,POMPEY,"rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very"
II,I,POMPEY,"honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could"
II,I,POMPEY,"not give you three-pence again."
II,I,FROTH,"No, indeed."
II,I,POMPEY,"Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,"
II,I,POMPEY,"cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--"
II,I,FROTH,"Ay, so I did indeed."
II,I,POMPEY,"Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be"
II,I,POMPEY,"remembered, that such a one and such a one were past"
II,I,POMPEY,"cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very"
II,I,POMPEY,"good diet, as I told you,--"
II,I,FROTH,"All this is true."
II,I,POMPEY,"Why, very well, then,--"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What"
II,I,ESCALUS,"was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to"
II,I,ESCALUS,"complain of? Come me to what was done to her."
II,I,POMPEY,"Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet."
II,I,ESCALUS,"No, sir, nor I mean it not."
II,I,POMPEY,"Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's"
II,I,POMPEY,"leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth"
II,I,POMPEY,"here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose"
II,I,POMPEY,"father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,"
II,I,POMPEY,"Master Froth?"
II,I,FROTH,"All-hallond eve."
II,I,POMPEY,"Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,"
II,I,POMPEY,"sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in"
II,I,POMPEY,"the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight"
II,I,POMPEY,"to sit, have you not?"
II,I,FROTH,"I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter."
II,I,POMPEY,"Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths."
II,I,ANGELO,"This will last out a night in Russia,"
II,I,ANGELO,"When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave."
II,I,ANGELO,"And leave you to the hearing of the cause;"
II,I,ANGELO,"Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all."
II,I,ESCALUS,"I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?"
II,I,POMPEY,"Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once."
II,I,ELBOW,"I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife."
II,I,POMPEY,"I beseech your honour, ask me."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?"
II,I,POMPEY,"I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face."
II,I,POMPEY,"Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a"
II,I,POMPEY,"good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Ay, sir, very well."
II,I,POMPEY,"Nay; I beseech you, mark it well."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Well, I do so."
II,I,POMPEY,"Doth your honour see any harm in his face?"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Why, no."
II,I,POMPEY,"I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst"
II,I,POMPEY,"thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the"
II,I,POMPEY,"worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the"
II,I,POMPEY,"constable's wife any harm? I would know that of"
II,I,POMPEY,"your honour."
II,I,ESCALUS,"He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?"
II,I,ELBOW,"First, an it like you, the house is a respected"
II,I,ELBOW,"house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his"
II,I,ELBOW,"mistress is a respected woman."
II,I,POMPEY,"By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected"
II,I,POMPEY,"person than any of us all."
II,I,ELBOW,"Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the"
II,I,ELBOW,"time has yet to come that she was ever respected"
II,I,ELBOW,"with man, woman, or child."
II,I,POMPEY,"Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is"
II,I,ESCALUS,"this true?"
II,I,ELBOW,"O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked"
II,I,ELBOW,"Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married"
II,I,ELBOW,"to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she"
II,I,ELBOW,"with me, let not your worship think me the poor"
II,I,ELBOW,"duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or"
II,I,ELBOW,"I'll have mine action of battery on thee."
II,I,ESCALUS,"If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your"
II,I,ESCALUS,"action of slander too."
II,I,ELBOW,"Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't"
II,I,ELBOW,"your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him"
II,I,ESCALUS,"that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him"
II,I,ESCALUS,"continue in his courses till thou knowest what they"
II,I,ESCALUS,"are."
II,I,ELBOW,"Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou"
II,I,ELBOW,"wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art"
II,I,ELBOW,"to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Where were you born, friend?"
II,I,FROTH,"Here in Vienna, sir."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Are you of fourscore pounds a year?"
II,I,FROTH,"Yes, an't please you, sir."
II,I,ESCALUS,"So. What trade are you of, sir?"
II,I,POMPHEY,"Tapster; a poor widow's tapster."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Your mistress' name?"
II,I,POMPHEY,"Mistress Overdone."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Hath she had any more than one husband?"
II,I,POMPEY,"Nine, sir; Overdone by the last."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Froth, I would not have you acquainted with"
II,I,ESCALUS,"tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you"
II,I,ESCALUS,"will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no"
II,I,ESCALUS,"more of you."
II,I,FROTH,"I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never"
II,I,FROTH,"come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn"
II,I,FROTH,"in."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your"
II,I,ESCALUS,"name, Master tapster?"
II,I,POMPEY,"Pompey."
II,I,ESCALUS,"What else?"
II,I,POMPEY,"Bum, sir."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;"
II,I,ESCALUS,"so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you"
II,I,ESCALUS,"not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you."
II,I,POMPEY,"Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live."
II,I,ESCALUS,"How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What"
II,I,ESCALUS,"do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?"
II,I,POMPEY,"If the law would allow it, sir."
II,I,ESCALUS,"But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall"
II,I,ESCALUS,"not be allowed in Vienna."
II,I,POMPEY,"Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the"
II,I,POMPEY,"youth of the city?"
II,I,ESCALUS,"No, Pompey."
II,I,POMPEY,"Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then."
II,I,POMPEY,"If your worship will take order for the drabs and"
II,I,POMPEY,"the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds."
II,I,ESCALUS,"There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:"
II,I,ESCALUS,"it is but heading and hanging."
II,I,POMPEY,"If you head and hang all that offend that way but"
II,I,POMPEY,"for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a"
II,I,POMPEY,"commission for more heads: if this law hold in"
II,I,POMPEY,"Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it"
II,I,POMPEY,"after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this"
II,I,POMPEY,"come to pass, say Pompey told you so."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your"
II,I,ESCALUS,"prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find"
II,I,ESCALUS,"you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;"
II,I,ESCALUS,"no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall"
II,I,ESCALUS,"have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well."
II,I,POMPEY,"I thank your worship for your good counsel:"
II,I,POMPEY,"but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall"
II,I,POMPEY,"better determine."
II,I,POMPEY,"Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:"
II,I,POMPEY,"The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master"
II,I,ESCALUS,"constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?"
II,I,ELBOW,"Seven year and a half, sir."
II,I,ESCALUS,"I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had"
II,I,ESCALUS,"continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?"
II,I,ELBOW,"And a half, sir."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you"
II,I,ESCALUS,"wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men"
II,I,ESCALUS,"in your ward sufficient to serve it?"
II,I,ELBOW,"Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they"
II,I,ELBOW,"are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I"
II,I,ELBOW,"do it for some piece of money, and go through with"
II,I,ELBOW,"all."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,"
II,I,ESCALUS,"the most sufficient of your parish."
II,I,ELBOW,"To your worship's house, sir?"
II,I,ESCALUS,"To my house. Fare you well."
II,I,ESCALUS,"What's o'clock, think you?"
II,I,Justice,"Eleven, sir."
II,I,ESCALUS,"I pray you home to dinner with me."
II,I,Justice,"I humbly thank you."
II,I,ESCALUS,"It grieves me for the death of Claudio;"
II,I,ESCALUS,"But there's no remedy."
II,I,Justice,"Lord Angelo is severe."
II,I,ESCALUS,"It is but needful:"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;"
II,I,ESCALUS,"Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:"
II,I,ESCALUS,"But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy."
II,I,ESCALUS,"Come, sir."
II,II,Servant,"He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight"
II,II,Servant,"I'll tell him of you."
II,II,Provost,"Pray you, do."
II,II,Provost,"I'll know"
II,II,Provost,"His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,"
II,II,Provost,"He hath but as offended in a dream!"
II,II,Provost,"All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he"
II,II,Provost,"To die for't!"
II,II,ANGELO,"Now, what's the matter. Provost?"
II,II,Provost,"Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?"
II,II,ANGELO,"Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?"
II,II,ANGELO,"Why dost thou ask again?"
II,II,Provost,"Lest I might be too rash:"
II,II,Provost,"Under your good correction, I have seen,"
II,II,Provost,"When, after execution, judgment hath"
II,II,Provost,"Repented o'er his doom."
II,II,ANGELO,"Go to; let that be mine:"
II,II,ANGELO,"Do you your office, or give up your place,"
II,II,ANGELO,"And you shall well be spared."
II,II,Provost,"I crave your honour's pardon."
II,II,Provost,"What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?"
II,II,Provost,"She's very near her hour."
II,II,ANGELO,"Dispose of her"
II,II,ANGELO,"To some more fitter place, and that with speed."
II,II,Servant,"Here is the sister of the man condemn'd"
II,II,Servant,"Desires access to you."
II,II,ANGELO,"Hath he a sister?"
II,II,Provost,"Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,"
II,II,Provost,"And to be shortly of a sisterhood,"
II,II,Provost,"If not already."
II,II,ANGELO,"Well, let her be admitted."
II,II,ANGELO,"See you the fornicatress be removed:"
II,II,ANGELO,"Let have needful, but not lavish, means;"
II,II,ANGELO,"There shall be order for't."
II,II,Provost,"God save your honour!"
II,II,ANGELO,"Stay a little while."
II,II,ANGELO,"You're welcome: what's your will?"
II,II,ISABELLA,"I am a woeful suitor to your honour,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Please but your honour hear me."
II,II,ANGELO,"Well; what's your suit?"
II,II,ISABELLA,"There is a vice that most I do abhor,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"And most desire should meet the blow of justice;"
II,II,ISABELLA,"For which I would not plead, but that I must;"
II,II,ISABELLA,"For which I must not plead, but that I am"
II,II,ISABELLA,"At war 'twixt will and will not."
II,II,ANGELO,"Well; the matter?"
II,II,ISABELLA,"I have a brother is condemn'd to die:"
II,II,ISABELLA,"I do beseech you, let it be his fault,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"And not my brother."
II,II,ANGELO,"Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?"
II,II,ANGELO,"Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:"
II,II,ANGELO,"Mine were the very cipher of a function,"
II,II,ANGELO,"To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,"
II,II,ANGELO,"And let go by the actor."
II,II,ISABELLA,"O just but severe law!"
II,II,ISABELLA,"I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!"
II,II,LUCIO,"again, entreat him;"
II,II,LUCIO,"Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:"
II,II,LUCIO,"You are too cold; if you should need a pin,"
II,II,LUCIO,"You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:"
II,II,LUCIO,"To him, I say!"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Must he needs die?"
II,II,ANGELO,"Maiden, no remedy."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy."
II,II,ANGELO,"I will not do't."
II,II,ISABELLA,"But can you, if you would?"
II,II,ANGELO,"Look, what I will not, that I cannot do."
II,II,ISABELLA,"But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse"
II,II,ISABELLA,"As mine is to him?"
II,II,ANGELO,"He's sentenced; 'tis too late."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word."
II,II,ISABELLA,"May call it back again. Well, believe this,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Become them with one half so good a grace"
II,II,ISABELLA,"As mercy does."
II,II,ISABELLA,"If he had been as you and you as he,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Would not have been so stern."
II,II,ANGELO,"Pray you, be gone."
II,II,ISABELLA,"I would to heaven I had your potency,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?"
II,II,ISABELLA,"No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"And what a prisoner."
II,II,LUCIO,"Ay, touch him; there's the vein."
II,II,ANGELO,"Your brother is a forfeit of the law,"
II,II,ANGELO,"And you but waste your words."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Alas, alas!"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;"
II,II,ISABELLA,"And He that might the vantage best have took"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Found out the remedy. How would you be,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"If He, which is the top of judgment, should"
II,II,ISABELLA,"But judge you as you are? O, think on that;"
II,II,ISABELLA,"And mercy then will breathe within your lips,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Like man new made."
II,II,ANGELO,"Be you content, fair maid;"
II,II,ANGELO,"It is the law, not I condemn your brother:"
II,II,ANGELO,"Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,"
II,II,ANGELO,"It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow."
II,II,ISABELLA,"To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!"
II,II,ISABELLA,"He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens"
II,II,ISABELLA,"We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven"
II,II,ISABELLA,"With less respect than we do minister"
II,II,ISABELLA,"To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Who is it that hath died for this offence?"
II,II,ISABELLA,"There's many have committed it."
II,II,ANGELO,"The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:"
II,II,ANGELO,"Those many had not dared to do that evil,"
II,II,ANGELO,"If the first that did the edict infringe"
II,II,ANGELO,"Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake"
II,II,ANGELO,"Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,"
II,II,ANGELO,"And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Are now to have no successive degrees,"
II,II,ANGELO,"But, ere they live, to end."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Yet show some pity."
II,II,ANGELO,"I show it most of all when I show justice;"
II,II,ANGELO,"For then I pity those I do not know,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;"
II,II,ANGELO,"And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;"
II,II,ANGELO,"Your brother dies to-morrow; be content."
II,II,ISABELLA,"So you must be the first that gives this sentence,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent"
II,II,ISABELLA,"To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous"
II,II,ISABELLA,"To use it like a giant."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Could great men thunder"
II,II,ISABELLA,"As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"For every pelting, petty officer"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Would use his heaven for thunder;"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Drest in a little brief authority,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Most ignorant of what he's most assured,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"His glassy essence, like an angry ape,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven"
II,II,ISABELLA,"As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Would all themselves laugh mortal."
II,II,LUCIO,"will relent;"
II,II,LUCIO,"He's coming; I perceive 't."
II,II,ISABELLA,"We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"But in the less foul profanation."
II,II,LUCIO,"Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that."
II,II,ISABELLA,"That in the captain's but a choleric word,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy."
II,II,ANGELO,"Why do you put these sayings upon me?"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Because authority, though it err like others,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know"
II,II,ISABELLA,"That's like my brother's fault: if it confess"
II,II,ISABELLA,"A natural guiltiness such as is his,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Against my brother's life."
II,II,ANGELO,"Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Gentle my lord, turn back."
II,II,ANGELO,"I will bethink me: come again tomorrow."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back."
II,II,ANGELO,"How! bribe me?"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor"
II,II,ISABELLA,"As fancy values them; but with true prayers"
II,II,ISABELLA,"That shall be up at heaven and enter there"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,"
II,II,ISABELLA,"From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate"
II,II,ISABELLA,"To nothing temporal."
II,II,ANGELO,"Well; come to me to-morrow."
II,II,ISABELLA,"Heaven keep your honour safe!"
II,II,ANGELO,"For I am that way going to temptation,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Where prayers cross."
II,II,ISABELLA,"At what hour to-morrow"
II,II,ISABELLA,"Shall I attend your lordship?"
II,II,ANGELO,"At any time 'fore noon."
II,II,ISABELLA,"'Save your honour!"
II,II,ANGELO,"From thee, even from thy virtue!"
II,II,ANGELO,"What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?"
II,II,ANGELO,"The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?"
II,II,ANGELO,"Ha!"
II,II,ANGELO,"Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I"
II,II,ANGELO,"That, lying by the violet in the sun,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be"
II,II,ANGELO,"That modesty may more betray our sense"
II,II,ANGELO,"Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary"
II,II,ANGELO,"And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!"
II,II,ANGELO,"What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?"
II,II,ANGELO,"Dost thou desire her foully for those things"
II,II,ANGELO,"That make her good? O, let her brother live!"
II,II,ANGELO,"Thieves for their robbery have authority"
II,II,ANGELO,"When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,"
II,II,ANGELO,"That I desire to hear her speak again,"
II,II,ANGELO,"And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?"
II,II,ANGELO,"O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,"
II,II,ANGELO,"With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous"
II,II,ANGELO,"Is that temptation that doth goad us on"
II,II,ANGELO,"To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,"
II,II,ANGELO,"With all her double vigour, art and nature,"
II,II,ANGELO,"Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid"
II,II,ANGELO,"Subdues me quite. Even till now,"
II,II,ANGELO,"When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hail to you, provost! so I think you are."
II,III,Provost,"I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Bound by my charity and my blest order,"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I come to visit the afflicted spirits"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Here in the prison. Do me the common right"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To let me see them and to make me know"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The nature of their crimes, that I may minister"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To them accordingly."
II,III,Provost,"I would do more than that, if more were needful."
II,III,Provost,"Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,"
II,III,Provost,"Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,"
II,III,Provost,"Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;"
II,III,Provost,"And he that got it, sentenced; a young man"
II,III,Provost,"More fit to do another such offence"
II,III,Provost,"Than die for this."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"When must he die?"
II,III,Provost,"As I do think, to-morrow."
II,III,Provost,"I have provided for you: stay awhile,"
II,III,Provost,"And you shall be conducted."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?"
II,III,JULIET,"I do; and bear the shame most patiently."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And try your penitence, if it be sound,"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Or hollowly put on."
II,III,JULIET,"I'll gladly learn."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Love you the man that wrong'd you?"
II,III,JULIET,"Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"So then it seems your most offenceful act"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Was mutually committed?"
II,III,JULIET,"Mutually."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Then was your sin of heavier kind than his."
II,III,JULIET,"I do confess it, and repent it, father."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But as we stand in fear,--"
II,III,JULIET,"I do repent me, as it is an evil,"
II,III,JULIET,"And take the shame with joy."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"There rest."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,"
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And I am going with instruction to him."
II,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Grace go with you, Benedicite!"
II,III,JULIET,"Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,"
II,III,JULIET,"That respites me a life, whose very comfort"
II,III,JULIET,"Is still a dying horror!"
II,III,Provost,"'Tis pity of him."
II,IV,ANGELO,"When I would pray and think, I think and pray"
II,IV,ANGELO,"To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"As if I did but only chew his name;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"And in my heart the strong and swelling evil"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Is like a good thing, being often read,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Could I with boot change for an idle plume,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls"
II,IV,ANGELO,"To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:"
II,IV,ANGELO,"'Tis not the devil's crest."
II,IV,ANGELO,"How now! who's there?"
II,IV,Servant,"One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Teach her the way."
II,IV,ANGELO,"O heavens!"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Making both it unable for itself,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"And dispossessing all my other parts"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Of necessary fitness?"
II,IV,ANGELO,"So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Come all to help him, and so stop the air"
II,IV,ANGELO,"By which he should revive: and even so"
II,IV,ANGELO,"The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Must needs appear offence."
II,IV,ANGELO,"How now, fair maid?"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"I am come to know your pleasure."
II,IV,ANGELO,"That you might know it, would much better please me"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Even so. Heaven keep your honour!"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"As long as you or I yet he must die."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Under your sentence?"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Yea."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"That his soul sicken not."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good"
II,IV,ANGELO,"To pardon him that hath from nature stolen"
II,IV,ANGELO,"A man already made, as to remit"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image"
II,IV,ANGELO,"In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Falsely to take away a life true made"
II,IV,ANGELO,"As to put metal in restrained means"
II,IV,ANGELO,"To make a false one."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Which had you rather, that the most just law"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness"
II,IV,ANGELO,"As she that he hath stain'd?"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Sir, believe this,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"I had rather give my body than my soul."
II,IV,ANGELO,"I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Stand more for number than for accompt."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"How say you?"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Against the thing I say. Answer to this:"
II,IV,ANGELO,"I, now the voice of the recorded law,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Might there not be a charity in sin"
II,IV,ANGELO,"To save this brother's life?"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Please you to do't,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"I'll take it as a peril to my soul,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"It is no sin at all, but charity."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Were equal poise of sin and charity."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"That I do beg his life, if it be sin,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"To have it added to the faults of mine,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"And nothing of your answer."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Nay, but hear me."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Or seem so craftily; and that's not good."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"But graciously to know I am no better."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright"
II,IV,ANGELO,"When it doth tax itself; as these black masks"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Your brother is to die."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"So."
II,IV,ANGELO,"And his offence is so, as it appears,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Accountant to the law upon that pain."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"True."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Admit no other way to save his life,--"
II,IV,ANGELO,"As I subscribe not that, nor any other,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Finding yourself desired of such a person,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Could fetch your brother from the manacles"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Of the all-building law; and that there were"
II,IV,ANGELO,"No earthly mean to save him, but that either"
II,IV,ANGELO,"You must lay down the treasures of your body"
II,IV,ANGELO,"To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"What would you do?"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"As much for my poor brother as myself:"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"That is, were I under the terms of death,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"And strip myself to death, as to a bed"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"My body up to shame."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Then must your brother die."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"And 'twere the cheaper way:"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Better it were a brother died at once,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Than that a sister, by redeeming him,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Should die for ever."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Were not you then as cruel as the sentence"
II,IV,ANGELO,"That you have slander'd so?"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Ignomy in ransom and free pardon"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Are of two houses: lawful mercy"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Is nothing kin to foul redemption."
II,IV,ANGELO,"You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"And rather proved the sliding of your brother"
II,IV,ANGELO,"A merriment than a vice."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"I something do excuse the thing I hate,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"For his advantage that I dearly love."
II,IV,ANGELO,"We are all frail."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Else let my brother die,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"If not a feodary, but only he"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Owe and succeed thy weakness."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Nay, women are frail too."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Which are as easy broke as they make forms."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"For we are soft as our complexions are,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"And credulous to false prints."
II,IV,ANGELO,"I think it well:"
II,IV,ANGELO,"And from this testimony of your own sex,--"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"I do arrest your words. Be that you are,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"If you be one, as you are well express'd"
II,IV,ANGELO,"By all external warrants, show it now,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"By putting on the destined livery."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Let me entreat you speak the former language."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Plainly conceive, I love you."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"My brother did love Juliet,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"And you tell me that he shall die for it."
II,IV,ANGELO,"He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"I know your virtue hath a licence in't,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Which seems a little fouler than it is,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"To pluck on others."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Believe me, on mine honour,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"My words express my purpose."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Ha! little honour to be much believed,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Sign me a present pardon for my brother,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"What man thou art."
II,IV,ANGELO,"Who will believe thee, Isabel?"
II,IV,ANGELO,"My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Will so your accusation overweigh,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"That you shall stifle in your own report"
II,IV,ANGELO,"And smell of calumny. I have begun,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"And now I give my sensual race the rein:"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother"
II,IV,ANGELO,"By yielding up thy body to my will;"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Or else he must not only die the death,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"But thy unkindness shall his death draw out"
II,IV,ANGELO,"To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Or, by the affection that now guides me most,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,"
II,IV,ANGELO,"Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Either of condemnation or approof;"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"That, had he twenty heads to tender down"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Before his sister should her body stoop"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"To such abhorr'd pollution."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"More than our brother is our chastity."
II,IV,ISABELLA,"I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,"
II,IV,ISABELLA,"And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"The miserable have no other medicine"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"But only hope:"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"I've hope to live, and am prepared to die."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Be absolute for death; either death or life"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Servile to all the skyey influences,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For all the accommodations that thou bear'st"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The mere effusion of thy proper loins,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That bears the name of life? Yet in this life"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That makes these odds all even."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"I humbly thank you."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"To sue to live, I find I seek to die;"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"And, seeking death, find life: let it come on."
III,I,Provost,"Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Most holy sir, I thank you."
III,I,ISABELLA,"My business is a word or two with Claudio."
III,I,Provost,"And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Provost, a word with you."
III,I,Provost,"As many as you please."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Now, sister, what's the comfort?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Why,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Intends you for his swift ambassador,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Therefore your best appointment make with speed;"
III,I,ISABELLA,"To-morrow you set on."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Is there no remedy?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"None, but such remedy as, to save a head,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"To cleave a heart in twain."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"But is there any?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Yes, brother, you may live:"
III,I,ISABELLA,"There is a devilish mercy in the judge,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"If you'll implore it, that will free your life,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"But fetter you till death."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Perpetual durance?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Though all the world's vastidity you had,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"To a determined scope."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"But in what nature?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"In such a one as, you consenting to't,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"And leave you naked."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Let me know the point."
III,I,ISABELLA,"O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"And six or seven winters more respect"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"The sense of death is most in apprehension;"
III,I,ISABELLA,"And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great"
III,I,ISABELLA,"As when a giant dies."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Why give you me this shame?"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Think you I can a resolution fetch"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"From flowery tenderness? If I must die,"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"I will encounter darkness as a bride,"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"And hug it in mine arms."
III,I,ISABELLA,"There spake my brother; there my father's grave"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Thou art too noble to conserve a life"
III,I,ISABELLA,"In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Whose settled visage and deliberate word"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew"
III,I,ISABELLA,"As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil"
III,I,ISABELLA,"His filth within being cast, he would appear"
III,I,ISABELLA,"A pond as deep as hell."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"The prenzie Angelo!"
III,I,ISABELLA,"O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"The damned'st body to invest and cover"
III,I,ISABELLA,"In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"If I would yield him my virginity,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Thou mightst be freed."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"O heavens! it cannot be."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"So to offend him still. This night's the time"
III,I,ISABELLA,"That I should do what I abhor to name,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Or else thou diest to-morrow."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Thou shalt not do't."
III,I,ISABELLA,"O, were it but my life,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"I'ld throw it down for your deliverance"
III,I,ISABELLA,"As frankly as a pin."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Thanks, dear Isabel."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Yes. Has he affections in him,"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Or of the deadly seven, it is the least."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Which is the least?"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"If it were damnable, he being so wise,"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Why would he for the momentary trick"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!"
III,I,ISABELLA,"What says my brother?"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Death is a fearful thing."
III,I,ISABELLA,"And shamed life a hateful."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"This sensible warm motion to become"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"And blown with restless violence round about"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"The pendent world; or to be worse than worst"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Of those that lawless and incertain thought"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"The weariest and most loathed worldly life"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"That age, ache, penury and imprisonment"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Can lay on nature is a paradise"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"To what we fear of death."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Alas, alas!"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Sweet sister, let me live:"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"What sin you do to save a brother's life,"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Nature dispenses with the deed so far"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"That it becomes a virtue."
III,I,ISABELLA,"O you beast!"
III,I,ISABELLA,"O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Is't not a kind of incest, to take life"
III,I,ISABELLA,"From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!"
III,I,ISABELLA,"For such a warped slip of wilderness"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Die, perish! Might but my bending down"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:"
III,I,ISABELLA,"I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,"
III,I,ISABELLA,"No word to save thee."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Nay, hear me, Isabel."
III,I,ISABELLA,"O, fie, fie, fie!"
III,I,ISABELLA,"Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:"
III,I,ISABELLA,"'Tis best thou diest quickly."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"O hear me, Isabella!"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word."
III,I,ISABELLA,"What is your will?"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"would require is likewise your own benefit."
III,I,ISABELLA,"I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be"
III,I,ISABELLA,"stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"hath made him that gracious denial which he is most"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"your knees and make ready."
III,I,CLAUDIO,"Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love"
III,I,CLAUDIO,"with life that I will sue to be rid of it."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hold you there: farewell."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Provost, a word with you!"
III,I,Provost,"What's your will, father"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"habit no loss shall touch her by my company."
III,I,Provost,"In good time."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"substitute, and to save your brother?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my"
III,I,ISABELLA,"brother die by the law than my son should be"
III,I,ISABELLA,"unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke"
III,I,ISABELLA,"deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can"
III,I,ISABELLA,"speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or"
III,I,ISABELLA,"discover his government."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"advisings: to the love I have in doing good a"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"person; and much please the absent duke, if"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"this business."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do"
III,I,ISABELLA,"anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"She should this Angelo have married; was affianced"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"which time of the contract and limit of the"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"having in that perished vessel the dowry of his"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"is washed with them, but relents not."
III,I,ISABELLA,"What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid"
III,I,ISABELLA,"from the world! What corruption in this life, that"
III,I,ISABELLA,"it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"you from dishonour in doing it."
III,I,ISABELLA,"Show me how, good father."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"like an impediment in the current, made it more"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"his demands to the point; only refer yourself to"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"this advantage, first, that your stay with him may"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"not be long; that the time may have all shadow and"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"silence in it; and the place answer to convenience."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"This being granted in course,--and now follows"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What think you of it?"
III,I,ISABELLA,"The image of it gives me content already; and I"
III,I,ISABELLA,"trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection."
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that"
III,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"it may be quickly."
III,I,ISABELLA,"I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father."
III,II,ELBOW,"Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will"
III,II,ELBOW,"needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we"
III,II,ELBOW,"shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O heavens! what stuff is here"
III,II,POMPEY,"'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the"
III,II,POMPEY,"merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by"
III,II,POMPEY,"order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and"
III,II,POMPEY,"furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that"
III,II,POMPEY,"craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing."
III,II,ELBOW,"Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And you, good brother father. What offence hath"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"this man made you, sir?"
III,II,ELBOW,"Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we"
III,II,ELBOW,"take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found"
III,II,ELBOW,"upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have"
III,II,ELBOW,"sent to the deputy."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The evil that thou causest to be done,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That is thy means to live. Do thou but think"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"From their abominable and beastly touches"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I drink, I eat, array myself, and live."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Canst thou believe thy living is a life,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend."
III,II,POMPEY,"Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,"
III,II,POMPEY,"sir, I would prove--"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Correction and instruction must both work"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Ere this rude beast will profit."
III,II,ELBOW,"He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him"
III,II,ELBOW,"warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if"
III,II,ELBOW,"he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were"
III,II,ELBOW,"as good go a mile on his errand."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That we were all, as some would seem to be,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!"
III,II,ELBOW,"His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir."
III,II,POMPEY,"I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a"
III,II,POMPEY,"friend of mine."
III,II,LUCIO,"How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of"
III,II,LUCIO,"Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there"
III,II,LUCIO,"none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be"
III,II,LUCIO,"had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and"
III,II,LUCIO,"extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What"
III,II,LUCIO,"sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't"
III,II,LUCIO,"not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest"
III,II,LUCIO,"thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is"
III,II,LUCIO,"the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The"
III,II,LUCIO,"trick of it?"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Still thus, and thus; still worse!"
III,II,LUCIO,"How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she"
III,II,LUCIO,"still, ha?"
III,II,POMPEY,"Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she"
III,II,POMPEY,"is herself in the tub."
III,II,LUCIO,"Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be"
III,II,LUCIO,"so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:"
III,II,LUCIO,"an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going"
III,II,LUCIO,"to prison, Pompey?"
III,II,POMPEY,"Yes, faith, sir."
III,II,LUCIO,"Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I"
III,II,LUCIO,"sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?"
III,II,ELBOW,"For being a bawd, for being a bawd."
III,II,LUCIO,"Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the"
III,II,LUCIO,"due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he"
III,II,LUCIO,"doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born."
III,II,LUCIO,"Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,"
III,II,LUCIO,"Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you"
III,II,LUCIO,"will keep the house."
III,II,POMPEY,"I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail."
III,II,LUCIO,"No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear."
III,II,LUCIO,"I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If"
III,II,LUCIO,"you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the"
III,II,LUCIO,"more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And you."
III,II,LUCIO,"Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?"
III,II,ELBOW,"Come your ways, sir; come."
III,II,POMPEY,"You will not bail me, then, sir?"
III,II,LUCIO,"Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?"
III,II,LUCIO,"what news?"
III,II,ELBOW,"Come your ways, sir; come."
III,II,LUCIO,"Go to kennel, Pompey; go."
III,II,LUCIO,"What news, friar, of the duke?"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I know none. Can you tell me of any?"
III,II,LUCIO,"Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other"
III,II,LUCIO,"some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well."
III,II,LUCIO,"It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from"
III,II,LUCIO,"the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born"
III,II,LUCIO,"to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he"
III,II,LUCIO,"puts transgression to 't."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He does well in 't."
III,II,LUCIO,"A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in"
III,II,LUCIO,"him: something too crabbed that way, friar."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it."
III,II,LUCIO,"Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;"
III,II,LUCIO,"it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp"
III,II,LUCIO,"it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put"
III,II,LUCIO,"down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and"
III,II,LUCIO,"woman after this downright way of creation: is it"
III,II,LUCIO,"true, think you?"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How should he be made, then?"
III,II,LUCIO,"Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he"
III,II,LUCIO,"was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is"
III,II,LUCIO,"certain that when he makes water his urine is"
III,II,LUCIO,"congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a"
III,II,LUCIO,"motion generative; that's infallible."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace."
III,II,LUCIO,"Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the"
III,II,LUCIO,"rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a"
III,II,LUCIO,"man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?"
III,II,LUCIO,"Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a"
III,II,LUCIO,"hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing"
III,II,LUCIO,"a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he"
III,II,LUCIO,"knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I never heard the absent duke much detected for"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"women; he was not inclined that way."
III,II,LUCIO,"O, sir, you are deceived."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis not possible."
III,II,LUCIO,"Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and"
III,II,LUCIO,"his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the"
III,II,LUCIO,"duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;"
III,II,LUCIO,"that let me inform you."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You do him wrong, surely."
III,II,LUCIO,"Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the"
III,II,LUCIO,"duke: and I believe I know the cause of his"
III,II,LUCIO,"withdrawing."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What, I prithee, might be the cause?"
III,II,LUCIO,"No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the"
III,II,LUCIO,"teeth and the lips: but this I can let you"
III,II,LUCIO,"understand, the greater file of the subject held the"
III,II,LUCIO,"duke to be wise."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Wise! why, no question but he was."
III,II,LUCIO,"A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"the very stream of his life and the business he hath"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice."
III,II,LUCIO,"Sir, I know him, and I love him."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"dearer love."
III,II,LUCIO,"Come, sir, I know what I know."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I can hardly believe that, since you know not what"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"upon you; and, I pray you, your name?"
III,II,LUCIO,"Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"report you."
III,II,LUCIO,"I fear you not."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again."
III,II,LUCIO,"I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,"
III,II,LUCIO,"friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if"
III,II,LUCIO,"Claudio die to-morrow or no?"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Why should he die, sir?"
III,II,LUCIO,"Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would"
III,II,LUCIO,"the duke we talk of were returned again: the"
III,II,LUCIO,"ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with"
III,II,LUCIO,"continency; sparrows must not build in his"
III,II,LUCIO,"house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke"
III,II,LUCIO,"yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would"
III,II,LUCIO,"never bring them to light: would he were returned!"
III,II,LUCIO,"Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing."
III,II,LUCIO,"Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The"
III,II,LUCIO,"duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on"
III,II,LUCIO,"Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,"
III,II,LUCIO,"he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown"
III,II,LUCIO,"bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"No might nor greatness in mortality"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But who comes here?"
III,II,ESCALUS,"Go; away with her to prison!"
III,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted"
III,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"a merciful man; good my lord."
III,II,ESCALUS,"Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in"
III,II,ESCALUS,"the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play"
III,II,ESCALUS,"the tyrant."
III,II,Provost,"A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please"
III,II,Provost,"your honour."
III,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me."
III,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the"
III,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child"
III,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:"
III,II,MISTRESS OVERDONE,"I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!"
III,II,ESCALUS,"That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be"
III,II,ESCALUS,"called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;"
III,II,ESCALUS,"no more words."
III,II,ESCALUS,"Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;"
III,II,ESCALUS,"Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished"
III,II,ESCALUS,"with divines, and have all charitable preparation."
III,II,ESCALUS,"if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be"
III,II,ESCALUS,"so with him."
III,II,Provost,"So please you, this friar hath been with him, and"
III,II,Provost,"advised him for the entertainment of death."
III,II,ESCALUS,"Good even, good father."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Bliss and goodness on you!"
III,II,ESCALUS,"Of whence are you?"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not of this country, though my chance is now"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To use it for my time: I am a brother"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of gracious order, late come from the See"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In special business from his holiness."
III,II,ESCALUS,"What news abroad i' the world?"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"None, but that there is so great a fever on"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"truth enough alive to make societies secure; but"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"security enough to make fellowships accurst: much"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?"
III,II,ESCALUS,"One that, above all other strifes, contended"
III,II,ESCALUS,"especially to know himself."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What pleasure was he given to?"
III,II,ESCALUS,"Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at"
III,II,ESCALUS,"any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a"
III,II,ESCALUS,"gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to"
III,II,ESCALUS,"his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;"
III,II,ESCALUS,"and let me desire to know how you find Claudio"
III,II,ESCALUS,"prepared. I am made to understand that you have"
III,II,ESCALUS,"lent him visitation."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He professes to have received no sinister measure"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"to the determination of justice: yet had he framed"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"deceiving promises of life; which I by my good"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"leisure have discredited to him, and now is he"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"resolved to die."
III,II,ESCALUS,"You have paid the heavens your function, and the"
III,II,ESCALUS,"prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have"
III,II,ESCALUS,"laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest"
III,II,ESCALUS,"shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I"
III,II,ESCALUS,"found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him"
III,II,ESCALUS,"he is indeed Justice."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"If his own life answer the straitness of his"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself."
III,II,ESCALUS,"I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Peace be with you!"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He who the sword of heaven will bear"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Should be as holy as severe;"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Pattern in himself to know,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Grace to stand, and virtue go;"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"More nor less to others paying"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Than by self-offences weighing."
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Shame to him whose cruel striking"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Kills for faults of his own liking!"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Twice treble shame on Angelo,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To weed my vice and let his grow!"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, what may man within him hide,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Though angel on the outward side!"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How may likeness made in crimes,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Making practise on the times,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To draw with idle spiders' strings"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Most ponderous and substantial things!"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Craft against vice I must apply:"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"With Angelo to-night shall lie"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"His old betrothed but despised;"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"So disguise shall, by the disguised,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Pay with falsehood false exacting,"
III,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And perform an old contracting."
IV,I,,"Take, O, take those lips away,"
IV,I,,"That so sweetly were forsworn;"
IV,I,,"And those eyes, the break of day,"
IV,I,,"Lights that do mislead the morn:"
IV,I,,"But my kisses bring again, bring again;"
IV,I,,"Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain."
IV,I,MARIANA,"Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:"
IV,I,MARIANA,"Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice"
IV,I,MARIANA,"Hath often still'd my brawling discontent."
IV,I,MARIANA,"I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish"
IV,I,MARIANA,"You had not found me here so musical:"
IV,I,MARIANA,"Let me excuse me, and believe me so,"
IV,I,MARIANA,"My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To make bad good, and good provoke to harm."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"for me here to-day? much upon this time have"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I promised here to meet."
IV,I,MARIANA,"You have not been inquired after:"
IV,I,MARIANA,"I have sat here all day."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I do constantly believe you. The time is come even"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself."
IV,I,MARIANA,"I am always bound to you."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Very well met, and well come."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What is the news from this good deputy?"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"He hath a garden circummured with brick,"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"And to that vineyard is a planched gate,"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"That makes his opening with this bigger key:"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"This other doth command a little door"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"There have I made my promise"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"Upon the heavy middle of the night"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"To call upon him."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But shall you on your knowledge find this way?"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"With whispering and most guilty diligence,"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"In action all of precept, he did show me"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"The way twice o'er."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Are there no other tokens"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Between you 'greed concerning her observance?"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"And that I have possess'd him my most stay"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"Can be but brief; for I have made him know"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"I have a servant comes with me along,"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"That stays upon me, whose persuasion is"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"I come about my brother."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis well borne up."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I have not yet made known to Mariana"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"She comes to do you good."
IV,I,ISABELLA,"I do desire the like."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?"
IV,I,MARIANA,"Good friar, I know you do, and have found it."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Take, then, this your companion by the hand,"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Who hath a story ready for your ear."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The vaporous night approaches."
IV,I,MARIANA,"Will't please you walk aside?"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O place and greatness! millions of false eyes"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Run with these false and most contrarious quests"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Make thee the father of their idle dreams"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And rack thee in their fancies."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Welcome, how agreed?"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"If you advise it."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is not my consent,"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But my entreaty too."
IV,I,ISABELLA,"Little have you to say"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"When you depart from him, but, soft and low,"
IV,I,ISABELLA,"'Remember now my brother.'"
IV,I,MARIANA,"Fear me not."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all."
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He is your husband on a pre-contract:"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sith that the justice of your title to him"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:"
IV,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow."
IV,II,Provost,"Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?"
IV,II,POMPEY,"If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a"
IV,II,POMPEY,"married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never"
IV,II,POMPEY,"cut off a woman's head."
IV,II,Provost,"Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a"
IV,II,Provost,"direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio"
IV,II,Provost,"and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common"
IV,II,Provost,"executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if"
IV,II,Provost,"you will take it on you to assist him, it shall"
IV,II,Provost,"redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have"
IV,II,Provost,"your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance"
IV,II,Provost,"with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a"
IV,II,Provost,"notorious bawd."
IV,II,POMPEY,"Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;"
IV,II,POMPEY,"but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I"
IV,II,POMPEY,"would be glad to receive some instruction from my"
IV,II,POMPEY,"fellow partner."
IV,II,Provost,"What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?"
IV,II,ABHORSON,"Do you call, sir?"
IV,II,Provost,"Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in"
IV,II,Provost,"your execution. If you think it meet, compound with"
IV,II,Provost,"him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if"
IV,II,Provost,"not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He"
IV,II,Provost,"cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd."
IV,II,ABHORSON,"A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery."
IV,II,Provost,"Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn"
IV,II,Provost,"the scale."
IV,II,POMPEY,"Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a"
IV,II,POMPEY,"good favour you have, but that you have a hanging"
IV,II,POMPEY,"look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?"
IV,II,ABHORSON,"Ay, sir; a mystery"
IV,II,POMPEY,"Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and"
IV,II,POMPEY,"your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,"
IV,II,POMPEY,"using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:"
IV,II,POMPEY,"but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I"
IV,II,POMPEY,"should be hanged, I cannot imagine."
IV,II,ABHORSON,"Sir, it is a mystery."
IV,II,POMPEY,"Proof?"
IV,II,ABHORSON,"Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be"
IV,II,ABHORSON,"too little for your thief, your true man thinks it"
IV,II,ABHORSON,"big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your"
IV,II,ABHORSON,"thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's"
IV,II,ABHORSON,"apparel fits your thief."
IV,II,Provost,"Are you agreed?"
IV,II,POMPEY,"Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is"
IV,II,POMPEY,"a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth"
IV,II,POMPEY,"oftener ask forgiveness."
IV,II,Provost,"You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe"
IV,II,Provost,"to-morrow four o'clock."
IV,II,ABHORSON,"Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow."
IV,II,POMPEY,"I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have"
IV,II,POMPEY,"occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find"
IV,II,POMPEY,"me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you"
IV,II,POMPEY,"a good turn."
IV,II,Provost,"Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:"
IV,II,Provost,"The one has my pity; not a jot the other,"
IV,II,Provost,"Being a murderer, though he were my brother."
IV,II,Provost,"Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:"
IV,II,Provost,"'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow"
IV,II,Provost,"Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?"
IV,II,CLAUDIO,"As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour"
IV,II,CLAUDIO,"When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:"
IV,II,CLAUDIO,"He will not wake."
IV,II,Provost,"Who can do good on him?"
IV,II,Provost,"Well, go, prepare yourself."
IV,II,Provost,"But, hark, what noise?"
IV,II,Provost,"Heaven give your spirits comfort!"
IV,II,Provost,"By and by."
IV,II,Provost,"I hope it is some pardon or reprieve"
IV,II,Provost,"For the most gentle Claudio."
IV,II,Provost,"Welcome father."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The best and wholesomest spirts of the night"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?"
IV,II,Provost,"None, since the curfew rung."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not Isabel?"
IV,II,Provost,"No."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"They will, then, ere't be long."
IV,II,Provost,"What comfort is for Claudio?"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"There's some in hope."
IV,II,Provost,"It is a bitter deputy."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He doth with holy abstinence subdue"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That in himself which he spurs on his power"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But this being so, he's just."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Now are they come."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"This is a gentle provost: seldom when"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The steeled gaoler is the friend of men."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes."
IV,II,Provost,"There he must stay until the officer"
IV,II,Provost,"Arise to let him in: he is call'd up."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But he must die to-morrow?"
IV,II,Provost,"None, sir, none."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As near the dawning, provost, as it is,"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You shall hear more ere morning."
IV,II,Provost,"Happily"
IV,II,Provost,"You something know; yet I believe there comes"
IV,II,Provost,"No countermand; no such example have we:"
IV,II,Provost,"Besides, upon the very siege of justice"
IV,II,Provost,"Lord Angelo hath to the public ear"
IV,II,Provost,"Profess'd the contrary."
IV,II,Provost,"This is his lordship's man."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And here comes Claudio's pardon."
IV,II,Messenger,"My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this"
IV,II,Messenger,"further charge, that you swerve not from the"
IV,II,Messenger,"smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or"
IV,II,Messenger,"other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,"
IV,II,Messenger,"it is almost day."
IV,II,Provost,"I shall obey him."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For which the pardoner himself is in."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hence hath offence his quick celerity,"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"When it is born in high authority:"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That for the fault's love is the offender friended."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Now, sir, what news?"
IV,II,Provost,"I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss"
IV,II,Provost,"in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted"
IV,II,Provost,"putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Pray you, let's hear."
IV,II,Provost,"'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let"
IV,II,Provost,"Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the"
IV,II,Provost,"afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,"
IV,II,Provost,"let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let"
IV,II,Provost,"this be duly performed; with a thought that more"
IV,II,Provost,"depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail"
IV,II,Provost,"not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'"
IV,II,Provost,"What say you to this, sir?"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"afternoon?"
IV,II,Provost,"A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one"
IV,II,Provost,"that is a prisoner nine years old."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How came it that the absent duke had not either"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"have heard it was ever his manner to do so."
IV,II,Provost,"His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,"
IV,II,Provost,"indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord"
IV,II,Provost,"Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is now apparent?"
IV,II,Provost,"Most manifest, and not denied by himself."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"seems he to be touched?"
IV,II,Provost,"A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but"
IV,II,Provost,"as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless"
IV,II,Provost,"of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of"
IV,II,Provost,"mortality, and desperately mortal."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He wants advice."
IV,II,Provost,"He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty"
IV,II,Provost,"of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he"
IV,II,Provost,"would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days"
IV,II,Provost,"entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if"
IV,II,Provost,"to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming"
IV,II,Provost,"warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"More of him anon. There is written in your brow,"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"sentenced him. To make you understand this in a"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"for the which you are to do me both a present and a"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"dangerous courtesy."
IV,II,Provost,"Pray, sir, in what?"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In the delaying death."
IV,II,Provost,"A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,"
IV,II,Provost,"and an express command, under penalty, to deliver"
IV,II,Provost,"his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case"
IV,II,Provost,"as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo."
IV,II,Provost,"Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"death: you know the course is common. If any thing"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"against it with my life."
IV,II,Provost,"Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?"
IV,II,Provost,"To him, and to his substitutes."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You will think you have made no offence, if the duke"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"avouch the justice of your dealing?"
IV,II,Provost,"But what likelihood is in that?"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"signet is not strange to you."
IV,II,Provost,"I know them both."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The contents of this is the return of the duke: you"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"shall find, within these two days he will be here."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"very day receives letters of strange tenor;"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"things should be: all difficulties are but easy"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"when they are known. Call your executioner, and off"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you"
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you."
IV,II,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Come away; it is almost clear dawn."
IV,III,POMPEY,"I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house"
IV,III,POMPEY,"of profession: one would think it were Mistress"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old"
IV,III,POMPEY,"customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in"
IV,III,POMPEY,"for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,"
IV,III,POMPEY,"ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made"
IV,III,POMPEY,"five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not"
IV,III,POMPEY,"much in request, for the old women were all dead."
IV,III,POMPEY,"Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of"
IV,III,POMPEY,"peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a"
IV,III,POMPEY,"beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the"
IV,III,POMPEY,"great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in"
IV,III,POMPEY,"our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'"
IV,III,ABHORSON,"Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither."
IV,III,POMPEY,"Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged."
IV,III,POMPEY,"Master Barnardine!"
IV,III,ABHORSON,"What, ho, Barnardine!"
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"noise there? What are you?"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so"
IV,III,POMPEY,"good, sir, to rise and be put to death."
IV,III,ABHORSON,"Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too."
IV,III,POMPEY,"Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are"
IV,III,POMPEY,"executed, and sleep afterwards."
IV,III,ABHORSON,"Go in to him, and fetch him out."
IV,III,POMPEY,"He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle."
IV,III,ABHORSON,"Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?"
IV,III,POMPEY,"Very ready, sir."
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?"
IV,III,ABHORSON,"Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your"
IV,III,ABHORSON,"prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come."
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not"
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"fitted for 't."
IV,III,POMPEY,"O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,"
IV,III,POMPEY,"and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the"
IV,III,POMPEY,"sounder all the next day."
IV,III,ABHORSON,"Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do"
IV,III,ABHORSON,"we jest now, think you?"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"you and pray with you."
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,"
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"and I will have more time to prepare me, or they"
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not"
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"consent to die this day, that's certain."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Look forward on the journey you shall go."
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"I swear I will not die to-day for any man's"
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"persuasion."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But hear you."
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,"
IV,III,BARNARDINE,"come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"After him, fellows; bring him to the block."
IV,III,Provost,"Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And to transport him in the mind he is"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Were damnable."
IV,III,Provost,"Here in the prison, father,"
IV,III,Provost,"There died this morning of a cruel fever"
IV,III,Provost,"One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,"
IV,III,Provost,"A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head"
IV,III,Provost,"Just of his colour. What if we do omit"
IV,III,Provost,"This reprobate till he were well inclined;"
IV,III,Provost,"And satisfy the deputy with the visage"
IV,III,Provost,"Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And sent according to command; whiles I"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die."
IV,III,Provost,"This shall be done, good father, presently."
IV,III,Provost,"But Barnardine must die this afternoon:"
IV,III,Provost,"And how shall we continue Claudio,"
IV,III,Provost,"To save me from the danger that might come"
IV,III,Provost,"If he were known alive?"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Let this be done."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To the under generation, you shall find"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Your safety manifested."
IV,III,Provost,"I am your free dependant."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Now will I write letters to Angelo,--"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Shall witness to him I am near at home,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And that, by great injunctions, I am bound"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To enter publicly: him I'll desire"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To meet me at the consecrated fount"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A league below the city; and from thence,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"By cold gradation and well-balanced form,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"We shall proceed with Angelo."
IV,III,Provost,"Here is the head; I'll carry it myself."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Convenient is it. Make a swift return;"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For I would commune with you of such things"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That want no ear but yours."
IV,III,Provost,"I'll make all speed."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But I will keep her ignorant of her good,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To make her heavenly comforts of despair,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"When it is least expected."
IV,III,ISABELLA,"Ho, by your leave!"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter."
IV,III,ISABELLA,"The better, given me by so holy a man."
IV,III,ISABELLA,"Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"His head is off and sent to Angelo."
IV,III,ISABELLA,"Nay, but it is not so."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In your close patience."
IV,III,ISABELLA,"O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You shall not be admitted to his sight."
IV,III,ISABELLA,"Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!"
IV,III,ISABELLA,"Injurious world! most damned Angelo!"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Mark what I say, which you shall find"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"By every syllable a faithful verity:"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"One of our convent, and his confessor,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Gives me this instance: already he hath carried"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Notice to Escalus and Angelo,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In that good path that I would wish it go,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And general honour."
IV,III,ISABELLA,"I am directed by you."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Say, by this token, I desire his company"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I am combined by a sacred vow"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Command these fretting waters from your eyes"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"With a light heart; trust not my holy order,"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"If I pervert your course. Who's here?"
IV,III,LUCIO,"Good even. Friar, where's the provost?"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not within, sir."
IV,III,LUCIO,"O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see"
IV,III,LUCIO,"thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain"
IV,III,LUCIO,"to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for"
IV,III,LUCIO,"my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set"
IV,III,LUCIO,"me to 't. But they say the duke will be here"
IV,III,LUCIO,"to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:"
IV,III,LUCIO,"if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been"
IV,III,LUCIO,"at home, he had lived."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"reports; but the best is, he lives not in them."
IV,III,LUCIO,"Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:"
IV,III,LUCIO,"he's a better woodman than thou takest him for."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well."
IV,III,LUCIO,"Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee"
IV,III,LUCIO,"I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You have told me too many of him already, sir, if"
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"they be true; if not true, none were enough."
IV,III,LUCIO,"I was once before him for getting a wench with child."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Did you such a thing?"
IV,III,LUCIO,"Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;"
IV,III,LUCIO,"they would else have married me to the rotten medlar."
IV,III,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well."
IV,III,LUCIO,"By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:"
IV,III,LUCIO,"if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of"
IV,III,LUCIO,"it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick."
IV,IV,ESCALUS,"Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other."
IV,IV,ANGELO,"In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"redeliver our authorities there"
IV,IV,ESCALUS,"I guess not."
IV,IV,ANGELO,"And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"they should exhibit their petitions in the street?"
IV,IV,ESCALUS,"He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of"
IV,IV,ESCALUS,"complaints, and to deliver us from devices"
IV,IV,ESCALUS,"hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand"
IV,IV,ESCALUS,"against us."
IV,IV,ANGELO,"Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"him."
IV,IV,ESCALUS,"I shall, sir. Fare you well."
IV,IV,ANGELO,"Good night."
IV,IV,ANGELO,"This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"And by an eminent body that enforced"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"The law against it! But that her tender shame"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"For my authority bears of a credent bulk,"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"That no particular scandal once can touch"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"By so receiving a dishonour'd life"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,"
IV,IV,ANGELO,"Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not."
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"These letters at fit time deliver me"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The provost knows our purpose and our plot."
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And hold you ever to our special drift;"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And tell him where I stay: give the like notice"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But send me Flavius first."
IV,V,FRIAR PETER,"It shall be speeded well."
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends"
IV,V,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius."
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"To speak so indirectly I am loath:"
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,"
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;"
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"He says, to veil full purpose."
IV,VI,MARIANA,"Be ruled by him."
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure"
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"He speak against me on the adverse side,"
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic"
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"That's bitter to sweet end."
IV,VI,MARIANA,"I would Friar Peter--"
IV,VI,ISABELLA,"O, peace! the friar is come."
IV,VI,FRIAR PETER,"Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,"
IV,VI,FRIAR PETER,"Where you may have such vantage on the duke,"
IV,VI,FRIAR PETER,"He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;"
IV,VI,FRIAR PETER,"The generous and gravest citizens"
IV,VI,FRIAR PETER,"Have hent the gates, and very near upon"
IV,VI,FRIAR PETER,"The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"My very worthy cousin, fairly met!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you."
V,I,ANGELO,"Happy return be to your royal grace!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Many and hearty thankings to you both."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"We have made inquiry of you; and we hear"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Such goodness of your justice, that our soul"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Forerunning more requital."
V,I,ANGELO,"You make my bonds still greater."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"When it deserves, with characters of brass,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And let the subject see, to make them know"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That outward courtesies would fain proclaim"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You must walk by us on our other hand;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And good supporters are you."
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him."
V,I,ISABELLA,"Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!"
V,I,ISABELLA,"O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye"
V,I,ISABELLA,"By throwing it on any other object"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Till you have heard me in my true complaint"
V,I,ISABELLA,"And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Reveal yourself to him."
V,I,ISABELLA,"O worthy duke,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"You bid me seek redemption of the devil:"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Must either punish me, not being believed,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!"
V,I,ANGELO,"My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:"
V,I,ANGELO,"She hath been a suitor to me for her brother"
V,I,ANGELO,"Cut off by course of justice,--"
V,I,ISABELLA,"By course of justice!"
V,I,ANGELO,"And she will speak most bitterly and strange."
V,I,ISABELLA,"Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:"
V,I,ISABELLA,"That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?"
V,I,ISABELLA,"That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?"
V,I,ISABELLA,"That Angelo is an adulterous thief,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Is it not strange and strange?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nay, it is ten times strange."
V,I,ISABELLA,"It is not truer he is Angelo"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Than this is all as true as it is strange:"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth"
V,I,ISABELLA,"To the end of reckoning."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Away with her! Poor soul,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"She speaks this in the infirmity of sense."
V,I,ISABELLA,"O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest"
V,I,ISABELLA,"There is another comfort than this world,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"That thou neglect me not, with that opinion"
V,I,ISABELLA,"That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible"
V,I,ISABELLA,"That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible"
V,I,ISABELLA,"But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute"
V,I,ISABELLA,"As Angelo; even so may Angelo,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:"
V,I,ISABELLA,"If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Had I more name for badness."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"By mine honesty,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Such a dependency of thing on thing,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As e'er I heard in madness."
V,I,ISABELLA,"O gracious duke,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason"
V,I,ISABELLA,"For inequality; but let your reason serve"
V,I,ISABELLA,"To make the truth appear where it seems hid,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"And hide the false seems true."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Many that are not mad"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?"
V,I,ISABELLA,"I am the sister of one Claudio,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Condemn'd upon the act of fornication"
V,I,ISABELLA,"To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:"
V,I,ISABELLA,"I, in probation of a sisterhood,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio"
V,I,ISABELLA,"As then the messenger,--"
V,I,LUCIO,"That's I, an't like your grace:"
V,I,LUCIO,"I came to her from Claudio, and desired her"
V,I,LUCIO,"To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo"
V,I,LUCIO,"For her poor brother's pardon."
V,I,ISABELLA,"That's he indeed."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You were not bid to speak."
V,I,LUCIO,"No, my good lord;"
V,I,LUCIO,"Nor wish'd to hold my peace."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I wish you now, then;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Pray you, take note of it: and when you have"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A business for yourself, pray heaven you then"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Be perfect."
V,I,LUCIO,"I warrant your honour."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The warrants for yourself; take heed to't."
V,I,ISABELLA,"This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--"
V,I,LUCIO,"Right."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It may be right; but you are i' the wrong"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To speak before your time. Proceed."
V,I,ISABELLA,"I went"
V,I,ISABELLA,"To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That's somewhat madly spoken."
V,I,ISABELLA,"Pardon it;"
V,I,ISABELLA,"The phrase is to the matter."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Mended again. The matter; proceed."
V,I,ISABELLA,"In brief, to set the needless process by,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--"
V,I,ISABELLA,"For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion"
V,I,ISABELLA,"I now begin with grief and shame to utter:"
V,I,ISABELLA,"He would not, but by gift of my chaste body"
V,I,ISABELLA,"To his concupiscible intemperate lust,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Release my brother; and, after much debatement,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant"
V,I,ISABELLA,"For my poor brother's head."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"This is most likely!"
V,I,ISABELLA,"O, that it were as like as it is true!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In hateful practise. First, his integrity"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That with such vehemency he should pursue"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Confess the truth, and say by whose advice"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thou camest here to complain."
V,I,ISABELLA,"And is this all?"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Then, O you blessed ministers above,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up"
V,I,ISABELLA,"In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To prison with her! Shall we thus permit"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"On him so near us? This needs must be a practise."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?"
V,I,ISABELLA,"One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?"
V,I,LUCIO,"My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;"
V,I,LUCIO,"I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord"
V,I,LUCIO,"For certain words he spake against your grace"
V,I,LUCIO,"In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And to set on this wretched woman here"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Against our substitute! Let this friar be found."
V,I,LUCIO,"But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,"
V,I,LUCIO,"I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,"
V,I,LUCIO,"A very scurvy fellow."
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Blessed be your royal grace!"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Most wrongfully accused your substitute,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Who is as free from touch or soil with her"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"As she from one ungot."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"We did believe no less."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"I know him for a man divine and holy;"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"As he's reported by this gentleman;"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"And, on my trust, a man that never yet"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace."
V,I,LUCIO,"My lord, most villanously; believe it."
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Well, he in time may come to clear himself;"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"But at this instant he is sick my lord,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Being come to knowledge that there was complaint"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Is true and false; and what he with his oath"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"And all probation will make up full clear,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman."
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"To justify this worthy nobleman,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"So vulgarly and personally accused,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Till she herself confess it."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Good friar, let's hear it."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In this I'll be impartial; be you judge"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"First, let her show her face, and after speak."
V,I,MARIANA,"Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face"
V,I,MARIANA,"Until my husband bid me."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What, are you married?"
V,I,MARIANA,"No, my lord."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Are you a maid?"
V,I,MARIANA,"No, my lord."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A widow, then?"
V,I,MARIANA,"Neither, my lord."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?"
V,I,LUCIO,"My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are"
V,I,LUCIO,"neither maid, widow, nor wife."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To prattle for himself."
V,I,LUCIO,"Well, my lord."
V,I,MARIANA,"My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;"
V,I,MARIANA,"And I confess besides I am no maid:"
V,I,MARIANA,"I have known my husband; yet my husband"
V,I,MARIANA,"Knows not that ever he knew me."
V,I,LUCIO,"He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!"
V,I,LUCIO,"Well, my lord."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"This is no witness for Lord Angelo."
V,I,MARIANA,"Now I come to't my lord"
V,I,MARIANA,"She that accuses him of fornication,"
V,I,MARIANA,"In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,"
V,I,MARIANA,"And charges him my lord, with such a time"
V,I,MARIANA,"When I'll depose I had him in mine arms"
V,I,MARIANA,"With all the effect of love."
V,I,ANGELO,"Charges she more than me?"
V,I,MARIANA,"Not that I know."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"No? you say your husband."
V,I,MARIANA,"Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,"
V,I,MARIANA,"Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,"
V,I,MARIANA,"But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's."
V,I,ANGELO,"This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face."
V,I,MARIANA,"My husband bids me; now I will unmask."
V,I,MARIANA,"This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,"
V,I,MARIANA,"Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;"
V,I,MARIANA,"This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,"
V,I,MARIANA,"Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body"
V,I,MARIANA,"That took away the match from Isabel,"
V,I,MARIANA,"And did supply thee at thy garden-house"
V,I,MARIANA,"In her imagined person."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Know you this woman?"
V,I,LUCIO,"Carnally, she says."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sirrah, no more!"
V,I,LUCIO,"Enough, my lord."
V,I,ANGELO,"My lord, I must confess I know this woman:"
V,I,ANGELO,"And five years since there was some speech of marriage"
V,I,ANGELO,"Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,"
V,I,ANGELO,"Partly for that her promised proportions"
V,I,ANGELO,"Came short of composition, but in chief"
V,I,ANGELO,"For that her reputation was disvalued"
V,I,ANGELO,"In levity: since which time of five years"
V,I,ANGELO,"I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,"
V,I,ANGELO,"Upon my faith and honour."
V,I,MARIANA,"Noble prince,"
V,I,MARIANA,"As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,"
V,I,MARIANA,"As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,"
V,I,MARIANA,"I am affianced this man's wife as strongly"
V,I,MARIANA,"As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,"
V,I,MARIANA,"But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house"
V,I,MARIANA,"He knew me as a wife. As this is true,"
V,I,MARIANA,"Let me in safety raise me from my knees"
V,I,MARIANA,"Or else for ever be confixed here,"
V,I,MARIANA,"A marble monument!"
V,I,ANGELO,"I did but smile till now:"
V,I,ANGELO,"Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice"
V,I,ANGELO,"My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive"
V,I,ANGELO,"These poor informal women are no more"
V,I,ANGELO,"But instruments of some more mightier member"
V,I,ANGELO,"That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,"
V,I,ANGELO,"To find this practise out."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Ay, with my heart"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And punish them to your height of pleasure."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Though they would swear down each particular saint,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Were testimonies against his worth and credit"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"There is another friar that set them on;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Let him be sent for."
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Hath set the women on to this complaint:"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"Your provost knows the place where he abides"
V,I,FRIAR PETER,"And he may fetch him."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Go do it instantly."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Do with your injuries as seems you best,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But stir not you till you have well determined"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Upon these slanderers."
V,I,ESCALUS,"My lord, we'll do it throughly."
V,I,ESCALUS,"Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?"
V,I,LUCIO,"'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing"
V,I,LUCIO,"but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most"
V,I,LUCIO,"villanous speeches of the duke."
V,I,ESCALUS,"We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and"
V,I,ESCALUS,"enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a"
V,I,ESCALUS,"notable fellow."
V,I,LUCIO,"As any in Vienna, on my word."
V,I,ESCALUS,"Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her."
V,I,ESCALUS,"Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you"
V,I,ESCALUS,"shall see how I'll handle her."
V,I,LUCIO,"Not better than he, by her own report."
V,I,ESCALUS,"Say you?"
V,I,LUCIO,"Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,"
V,I,LUCIO,"she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,"
V,I,LUCIO,"she'll be ashamed."
V,I,ESCALUS,"I will go darkly to work with her."
V,I,LUCIO,"That's the way; for women are light at midnight."
V,I,ESCALUS,"Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all"
V,I,ESCALUS,"that you have said."
V,I,LUCIO,"My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with"
V,I,LUCIO,"the provost."
V,I,ESCALUS,"In very good time: speak not you to him till we"
V,I,ESCALUS,"call upon you."
V,I,LUCIO,"Mum."
V,I,ESCALUS,"Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis false."
V,I,ESCALUS,"How! know you where you are?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Respect to your great place! and let the devil"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak."
V,I,ESCALUS,"The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Look you speak justly."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thus to retort your manifest appeal,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And put your trial in the villain's mouth"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Which here you come to accuse."
V,I,LUCIO,"This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of."
V,I,ESCALUS,"Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women"
V,I,ESCALUS,"To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth"
V,I,ESCALUS,"And in the witness of his proper ear,"
V,I,ESCALUS,"To call him villain? and then to glance from him"
V,I,ESCALUS,"To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose."
V,I,ESCALUS,"What 'unjust'!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Be not so hot; the duke"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nor here provincial. My business in this state"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Made me a looker on here in Vienna,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As much in mock as mark."
V,I,ESCALUS,"Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!"
V,I,ANGELO,"What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?"
V,I,ANGELO,"Is this the man that you did tell us of?"
V,I,LUCIO,"'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:"
V,I,LUCIO,"do you know me?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke."
V,I,LUCIO,"O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Most notedly, sir."
V,I,LUCIO,"Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a"
V,I,LUCIO,"fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"much more, much worse."
V,I,LUCIO,"O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the"
V,I,LUCIO,"nose for thy speeches?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I protest I love the duke as I love myself."
V,I,ANGELO,"Hark, how the villain would close now, after his"
V,I,ANGELO,"treasonable abuses!"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with"
V,I,ESCALUS,"him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him"
V,I,ESCALUS,"to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him"
V,I,ESCALUS,"speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and"
V,I,ESCALUS,"with the other confederate companion!"
V,I,ANGELO,"What, resists he? Help him, Lucio."
V,I,LUCIO,"Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you"
V,I,LUCIO,"bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must"
V,I,LUCIO,"you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!"
V,I,LUCIO,"show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!"
V,I,LUCIO,"Will't not off?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"First, provost, let me bail these gentle three."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him."
V,I,LUCIO,"This may prove worse than hanging."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"We'll borrow place of him."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sir, by your leave."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Rely upon it till my tale be heard,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And hold no longer out."
V,I,ANGELO,"O my dread lord,"
V,I,ANGELO,"I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,"
V,I,ANGELO,"To think I can be undiscernible,"
V,I,ANGELO,"When I perceive your grace, like power divine,"
V,I,ANGELO,"Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,"
V,I,ANGELO,"No longer session hold upon my shame,"
V,I,ANGELO,"But let my trial be mine own confession:"
V,I,ANGELO,"Immediate sentence then and sequent death"
V,I,ANGELO,"Is all the grace I beg."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Come hither, Mariana."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?"
V,I,ANGELO,"I was, my lord."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Go take her hence, and marry her instantly."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Do you the office, friar; which consummate,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Return him here again. Go with him, provost."
V,I,ESCALUS,"My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Than at the strangeness of it."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Come hither, Isabel."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Your friar is now your prince: as I was then"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Advertising and holy to your business,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not changing heart with habit, I am still"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Attorney'd at your service."
V,I,ISABELLA,"O, give me pardon,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Your unknown sovereignty!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You are pardon'd, Isabel:"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And now, dear maid, be you as free to us."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And you may marvel why I obscured myself,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Labouring to save his life, and would not rather"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It was the swift celerity of his death,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Which I did think with slower foot came on,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That life is better life, past fearing death,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"So happy is your brother."
V,I,ISABELLA,"I do, my lord."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For this new-married man approaching here,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Your well defended honour, you must pardon"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Being criminal, in double violation"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"The very mercy of the law cries out"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Most audible, even from his proper tongue,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"We do condemn thee to the very block"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Away with him!"
V,I,MARIANA,"O my most gracious lord,"
V,I,MARIANA,"I hope you will not mock me with a husband."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is your husband mock'd you with a husband."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For that he knew you, might reproach your life"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And choke your good to come; for his possessions,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Although by confiscation they are ours,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"We do instate and widow you withal,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To buy you a better husband."
V,I,MARIANA,"O my dear lord,"
V,I,MARIANA,"I crave no other, nor no better man."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Never crave him; we are definitive."
V,I,MARIANA,"Gentle my liege,--"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You do but lose your labour."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Away with him to death!"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Now, sir, to you."
V,I,MARIANA,"O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;"
V,I,MARIANA,"Lend me your knees, and all my life to come"
V,I,MARIANA,"I'll lend you all my life to do you service."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Against all sense you do importune her:"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And take her hence in horror."
V,I,MARIANA,"Isabel,"
V,I,MARIANA,"Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;"
V,I,MARIANA,"Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all."
V,I,MARIANA,"They say, best men are moulded out of faults;"
V,I,MARIANA,"And, for the most, become much more the better"
V,I,MARIANA,"For being a little bad: so may my husband."
V,I,MARIANA,"O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He dies for Claudio's death."
V,I,ISABELLA,"Most bounteous sir,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"As if my brother lived: I partly think"
V,I,ISABELLA,"A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Till he did look on me: since it is so,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Let him not die. My brother had but justice,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"In that he did the thing for which he died:"
V,I,ISABELLA,"For Angelo,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,"
V,I,ISABELLA,"And must be buried but as an intent"
V,I,ISABELLA,"That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;"
V,I,ISABELLA,"Intents but merely thoughts."
V,I,MARIANA,"Merely, my lord."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I have bethought me of another fault."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"At an unusual hour?"
V,I,Provost,"It was commanded so."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Had you a special warrant for the deed?"
V,I,Provost,"No, my good lord; it was by private message."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For which I do discharge you of your office:"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Give up your keys."
V,I,Provost,"Pardon me, noble lord:"
V,I,Provost,"I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;"
V,I,Provost,"Yet did repent me, after more advice;"
V,I,Provost,"For testimony whereof, one in the prison,"
V,I,Provost,"That should by private order else have died,"
V,I,Provost,"I have reserved alive."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What's he?"
V,I,Provost,"His name is Barnardine."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I would thou hadst done so by Claudio."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him."
V,I,ESCALUS,"I am sorry, one so learned and so wise"
V,I,ESCALUS,"As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,"
V,I,ESCALUS,"Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood."
V,I,ESCALUS,"And lack of temper'd judgment afterward."
V,I,ANGELO,"I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:"
V,I,ANGELO,"And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart"
V,I,ANGELO,"That I crave death more willingly than mercy;"
V,I,ANGELO,"'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Which is that Barnardine?"
V,I,Provost,"This, my lord."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"There was a friar told me of this man."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That apprehends no further than this world,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And pray thee take this mercy to provide"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For better times to come. Friar, advise him;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?"
V,I,Provost,"This is another prisoner that I saved."
V,I,Provost,"Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;"
V,I,Provost,"As like almost to Claudio as himself."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Give me your hand and say you will be mine."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"He is my brother too: but fitter time for that."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Methinks I see a quickening in his eye."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I find an apt remission in myself;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Wherein have I so deserved of you,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That you extol me thus?"
V,I,LUCIO,"'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the"
V,I,LUCIO,"trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I"
V,I,LUCIO,"had rather it would please you I might be whipt."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Whipt first, sir, and hanged after."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Proclaim it, provost, round about the city."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As I have heard him swear himself there's one"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Whom he begot with child, let her appear,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Let him be whipt and hang'd."
V,I,LUCIO,"I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore."
V,I,LUCIO,"Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:"
V,I,LUCIO,"good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her."
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal"
V,I,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;"
