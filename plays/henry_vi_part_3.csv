I,I,WARWICK,"I wonder how the king escaped our hands."
I,I,YORK,"While we pursued the horsemen of the north,"
I,I,YORK,"He slily stole away and left his men:"
I,I,YORK,"Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,"
I,I,YORK,"Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,"
I,I,YORK,"Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,"
I,I,YORK,"Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,"
I,I,YORK,"Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in"
I,I,YORK,"Were by the swords of common soldiers slain."
I,I,EDWARD,"Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,"
I,I,EDWARD,"Is either slain or wounded dangerously;"
I,I,EDWARD,"I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:"
I,I,EDWARD,"That this is true, father, behold his blood."
I,I,MONTAGUE,"And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,"
I,I,MONTAGUE,"Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd."
I,I,RICHARD,"Speak thou for me and tell them what I did."
I,I,YORK,"Richard hath best deserved of all my sons."
I,I,YORK,"But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!"
I,I,RICHARD,"Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head."
I,I,WARWICK,"And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,"
I,I,WARWICK,"Before I see thee seated in that throne"
I,I,WARWICK,"Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,"
I,I,WARWICK,"I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close."
I,I,WARWICK,"This is the palace of the fearful king,"
I,I,WARWICK,"And this the regal seat: possess it, York;"
I,I,WARWICK,"For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'"
I,I,YORK,"Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;"
I,I,YORK,"For hither we have broken in by force."
I,I,NORFOLK,"We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die."
I,I,YORK,"Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;"
I,I,YORK,"And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night."
I,I,WARWICK,"And when the king comes, offer no violence,"
I,I,WARWICK,"Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce."
I,I,YORK,"The queen this day here holds her parliament,"
I,I,YORK,"But little thinks we shall be of her council:"
I,I,YORK,"By words or blows here let us win our right."
I,I,RICHARD,"Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house."
I,I,WARWICK,"The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,"
I,I,WARWICK,"Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,"
I,I,WARWICK,"And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice"
I,I,WARWICK,"Hath made us by-words to our enemies."
I,I,YORK,"Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;"
I,I,YORK,"I mean to take possession of my right."
I,I,WARWICK,"Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,"
I,I,WARWICK,"The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,"
I,I,WARWICK,"Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells."
I,I,WARWICK,"I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:"
I,I,WARWICK,"Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Even in the chair of state: belike he means,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"To aspire unto the crown and reign as king."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends."
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel."
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland."
I,I,CLIFFORD,"Patience is for poltroons, such as he:"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"He durst not sit there, had your father lived."
I,I,CLIFFORD,"My gracious lord, here in the parliament"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"Let us assail the family of York."
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, know you not the city favours them,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?"
I,I,EXETER,"But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"To make a shambles of the parliament-house!"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Shall be the war that Henry means to use."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"I am thy sovereign."
I,I,YORK,"I am thine."
I,I,EXETER,"For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York."
I,I,YORK,"'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was."
I,I,EXETER,"Thy father was a traitor to the crown."
I,I,WARWICK,"Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown"
I,I,WARWICK,"In following this usurping Henry."
I,I,CLIFFORD,"Whom should he follow but his natural king?"
I,I,WARWICK,"True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?"
I,I,YORK,"It must and shall be so: content thyself."
I,I,WARWICK,"Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king."
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain."
I,I,WARWICK,"And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget"
I,I,WARWICK,"That we are those which chased you from the field"
I,I,WARWICK,"And slew your fathers, and with colours spread"
I,I,WARWICK,"March'd through the city to the palace gates."
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;"
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it."
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Than drops of blood were in my father's veins."
I,I,CLIFFORD,"Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"As shall revenge his death before I stir."
I,I,WARWICK,"Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!"
I,I,YORK,"Will you we show our title to the crown?"
I,I,YORK,"If not, our swords shall plead it in the field."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"I am the son of Henry the Fifth,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"And seized upon their towns and provinces."
I,I,WARWICK,"Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"The lord protector lost it, and not I:"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"When I was crown'd I was but nine months old."
I,I,RICHARD,"You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose."
I,I,RICHARD,"Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head."
I,I,EDWARD,"Sweet father, do so; set it on your head."
I,I,MONTAGUE,"Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,"
I,I,MONTAGUE,"Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus."
I,I,RICHARD,"Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly."
I,I,YORK,"Sons, peace!"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak."
I,I,WARWICK,"Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;"
I,I,WARWICK,"And be you silent and attentive too,"
I,I,WARWICK,"For he that interrupts him shall not live."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"My title's good, and better far than his."
I,I,WARWICK,"Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown."
I,I,YORK,"'Twas by rebellion against his king."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?"
I,I,YORK,"What then?"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"An if he may, then am I lawful king;"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"For Richard, in the view of many lords,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Whose heir my father was, and I am his."
I,I,YORK,"He rose against him, being his sovereign,"
I,I,YORK,"And made him to resign his crown perforce."
I,I,WARWICK,"Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,"
I,I,WARWICK,"Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?"
I,I,EXETER,"No; for he could not so resign his crown"
I,I,EXETER,"But that the next heir should succeed and reign."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?"
I,I,EXETER,"His is the right, and therefore pardon me."
I,I,YORK,"Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?"
I,I,EXETER,"My conscience tells me he is lawful king."
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,"
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Think not that Henry shall be so deposed."
I,I,WARWICK,"Deposed he shall be, in despite of all."
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,"
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,"
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,"
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Can set the duke up in despite of me."
I,I,CLIFFORD,"King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"May that ground gape and swallow me alive,"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!"
I,I,YORK,"Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown."
I,I,YORK,"What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?"
I,I,WARWICK,"Do right unto this princely Duke of York,"
I,I,WARWICK,"Or I will fill the house with armed men,"
I,I,WARWICK,"And over the chair of state, where now he sits,"
I,I,WARWICK,"Write up his title with usurping blood."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Let me for this my life-time reign as king."
I,I,YORK,"Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,"
I,I,YORK,"And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"I am content: Richard Plantagenet,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Enjoy the kingdom after my decease."
I,I,CLIFFORD,"What wrong is this unto the prince your son!"
I,I,WARWICK,"What good is this to England and himself!"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Base, fearful and despairing Henry!"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"How hast thou injured both thyself and us!"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"I cannot stay to hear these articles."
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Nor I."
I,I,CLIFFORD,"Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news."
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides."
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Be thou a prey unto the house of York,"
I,I,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And die in bands for this unmanly deed!"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,"
I,I,CLIFFORD,"Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!"
I,I,WARWICK,"Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not."
I,I,EXETER,"They seek revenge and therefore will not yield."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, Exeter!"
I,I,WARWICK,"Why should you sigh, my lord?"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"But be it as it may: I here entail"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Conditionally, that here thou take an oath"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"To honour me as thy king and sovereign,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"And neither by treason nor hostility"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"To seek to put me down and reign thyself."
I,I,YORK,"This oath I willingly take and will perform."
I,I,WARWICK,"Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"And long live thou and these thy forward sons!"
I,I,YORK,"Now York and Lancaster are reconciled."
I,I,EXETER,"Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!"
I,I,YORK,"Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle."
I,I,WARWICK,"And I'll keep London with my soldiers."
I,I,NORFOLK,"And I to Norfolk with my followers."
I,I,MONTAGUE,"And I unto the sea from whence I came."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court."
I,I,EXETER,"Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:"
I,I,EXETER,"I'll steal away."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Exeter, so will I."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Who can be patient in such extremes?"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"And never seen thee, never borne thee son,"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or felt that pain which I did for him once,"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Rather than have that savage duke thine heir"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"And disinherited thine only son."
I,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Father, you cannot disinherit me:"
I,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"If you be king, why should not I succeed?"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"And given unto the house of York such head"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"What is it, but to make thy sepulchre"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"And creep into it far before thy time?"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"The duke is made protector of the realm;"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"The trembling lamb environed with wolves."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Had I been there, which am a silly woman,"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Before I would have granted to that act."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Until that act of parliament be repeal'd"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Whereby my son is disinherited."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"And utter ruin of the house of York."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our army is ready; come, we'll after them."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?"
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies."
I,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"When I return with victory from the field"
I,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her."
I,I,QUEEN MARGARET,"Come, son, away; we may not linger thus."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Poor queen! how love to me and to her son"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Hath made her break out into terms of rage!"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"The loss of those three lords torments my heart:"
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"I'll write unto them and entreat them fair."
I,I,KING HENRY VI,"Come, cousin you shall be the messenger."
I,I,EXETER,"And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all."
I,I,EXETER,"3 KING HENRY VI"
I,II,RICHARD,"Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave."
I,II,EDWARD,"No, I can better play the orator."
I,II,MONTAGUE,"But I have reasons strong and forcible."
I,II,YORK,"Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?"
I,II,YORK,"What is your quarrel? how began it first?"
I,II,EDWARD,"No quarrel, but a slight contention."
I,II,YORK,"About what?"
I,II,RICHARD,"About that which concerns your grace and us;"
I,II,RICHARD,"The crown of England, father, which is yours."
I,II,YORK,"Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead."
I,II,RICHARD,"Your right depends not on his life or death."
I,II,EDWARD,"Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:"
I,II,EDWARD,"By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,"
I,II,EDWARD,"It will outrun you, father, in the end."
I,II,YORK,"I took an oath that he should quietly reign."
I,II,EDWARD,"But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:"
I,II,EDWARD,"I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year."
I,II,RICHARD,"No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn."
I,II,YORK,"I shall be, if I claim by open war."
I,II,RICHARD,"I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak."
I,II,YORK,"Thou canst not, son; it is impossible."
I,II,RICHARD,"An oath is of no moment, being not took"
I,II,RICHARD,"Before a true and lawful magistrate,"
I,II,RICHARD,"That hath authority over him that swears:"
I,II,RICHARD,"Henry had none, but did usurp the place;"
I,II,RICHARD,"Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,"
I,II,RICHARD,"Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous."
I,II,RICHARD,"Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think"
I,II,RICHARD,"How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;"
I,II,RICHARD,"Within whose circuit is Elysium"
I,II,RICHARD,"And all that poets feign of bliss and joy."
I,II,RICHARD,"Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest"
I,II,RICHARD,"Until the white rose that I wear be dyed"
I,II,RICHARD,"Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart."
I,II,YORK,"Richard, enough; I will be king, or die."
I,II,YORK,"Brother, thou shalt to London presently,"
I,II,YORK,"And whet on Warwick to this enterprise."
I,II,YORK,"Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,"
I,II,YORK,"And tell him privily of our intent."
I,II,YORK,"You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,"
I,II,YORK,"With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:"
I,II,YORK,"In them I trust; for they are soldiers,"
I,II,YORK,"Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit."
I,II,YORK,"While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,"
I,II,YORK,"But that I seek occasion how to rise,"
I,II,YORK,"And yet the king not privy to my drift,"
I,II,YORK,"Nor any of the house of Lancaster?"
I,II,YORK,"But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?"
I,II,Messenger,"The queen with all the northern earls and lords"
I,II,Messenger,"Intend here to besiege you in your castle:"
I,II,Messenger,"She is hard by with twenty thousand men;"
I,II,Messenger,"And therefore fortify your hold, my lord."
I,II,YORK,"Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?"
I,II,YORK,"Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;"
I,II,YORK,"My brother Montague shall post to London:"
I,II,YORK,"Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,"
I,II,YORK,"Whom we have left protectors of the king,"
I,II,YORK,"With powerful policy strengthen themselves,"
I,II,YORK,"And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths."
I,II,MONTAGUE,"Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:"
I,II,MONTAGUE,"And thus most humbly I do take my leave."
I,II,MONTAGUE,"Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,"
I,II,MONTAGUE,"You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;"
I,II,MONTAGUE,"The army of the queen mean to besiege us."
I,II,JOHN MORTIMER,"She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field."
I,II,YORK,"What, with five thousand men?"
I,II,RICHARD,"Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:"
I,II,RICHARD,"A woman's general; what should we fear?"
I,II,EDWARD,"I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,"
I,II,EDWARD,"And issue forth and bid them battle straight."
I,II,YORK,"Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,"
I,II,YORK,"I doubt not, uncle, of our victory."
I,II,YORK,"Many a battle have I won in France,"
I,II,YORK,"When as the enemy hath been ten to one:"
I,II,YORK,"Why should I not now have the like success?"
I,II,YORK,"3 KING HENRY VI"
I,III,RUTLAND,"Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?"
I,III,RUTLAND,"Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life."
I,III,CLIFFORD,"As for the brat of this accursed duke,"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Whose father slew my father, he shall die."
I,III,Tutor,"And I, my lord, will bear him company."
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Soldiers, away with him!"
I,III,Tutor,"Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,"
I,III,Tutor,"Lest thou be hated both of God and man!"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"How now! is he dead already? or is it fear"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them."
I,III,RUTLAND,"So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch"
I,III,RUTLAND,"That trembles under his devouring paws;"
I,III,RUTLAND,"And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,"
I,III,RUTLAND,"And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder."
I,III,RUTLAND,"Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,"
I,III,RUTLAND,"And not with such a cruel threatening look."
I,III,RUTLAND,"Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die."
I,III,RUTLAND,"I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:"
I,III,RUTLAND,"Be thou revenged on men, and let me live."
I,III,CLIFFORD,"In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter."
I,III,RUTLAND,"Then let my father's blood open it again:"
I,III,RUTLAND,"He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him."
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Were not revenge sufficient for me;"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart."
I,III,CLIFFORD,"The sight of any of the house of York"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Is as a fury to torment my soul;"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"And till I root out their accursed line"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"And leave not one alive, I live in hell."
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Therefore--"
I,III,RUTLAND,"O, let me pray before I take my death!"
I,III,RUTLAND,"To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Such pity as my rapier's point affords."
I,III,RUTLAND,"I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Thy father hath."
I,III,RUTLAND,"But 'twas ere I was born."
I,III,RUTLAND,"Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,"
I,III,RUTLAND,"Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,"
I,III,RUTLAND,"He be as miserably slain as I."
I,III,RUTLAND,"Ah, let me live in prison all my days;"
I,III,RUTLAND,"And when I give occasion of offence,"
I,III,RUTLAND,"Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause."
I,III,CLIFFORD,"No cause!"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Thy father slew my father; therefore, die."
I,III,RUTLAND,"Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,"
I,III,CLIFFORD,"Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both."
I,III,CLIFFORD,"3 KING HENRY VI"
I,IV,YORK,"The army of the queen hath got the field:"
I,IV,YORK,"My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;"
I,IV,YORK,"And all my followers to the eager foe"
I,IV,YORK,"Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind"
I,IV,YORK,"Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves."
I,IV,YORK,"My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:"
I,IV,YORK,"But this I know, they have demean'd themselves"
I,IV,YORK,"Like men born to renown by life or death."
I,IV,YORK,"Three times did Richard make a lane to me."
I,IV,YORK,"And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'"
I,IV,YORK,"And full as oft came Edward to my side,"
I,IV,YORK,"With purple falchion, painted to the hilt"
I,IV,YORK,"In blood of those that had encounter'd him:"
I,IV,YORK,"And when the hardiest warriors did retire,"
I,IV,YORK,"Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'"
I,IV,YORK,"And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!"
I,IV,YORK,"A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'"
I,IV,YORK,"With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!"
I,IV,YORK,"We bodged again; as I have seen a swan"
I,IV,YORK,"With bootless labour swim against the tide"
I,IV,YORK,"And spend her strength with over-matching waves."
I,IV,YORK,"Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;"
I,IV,YORK,"And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:"
I,IV,YORK,"And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:"
I,IV,YORK,"The sands are number'd that make up my life;"
I,IV,YORK,"Here must I stay, and here my life must end."
I,IV,YORK,"Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,"
I,IV,YORK,"I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:"
I,IV,YORK,"I am your butt, and I abide your shot."
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet."
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,"
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"With downright payment, show'd unto my father."
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,"
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"And made an evening at the noontide prick."
I,IV,YORK,"My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth"
I,IV,YORK,"A bird that will revenge upon you all:"
I,IV,YORK,"And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,"
I,IV,YORK,"Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with."
I,IV,YORK,"Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?"
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"So cowards fight when they can fly no further;"
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;"
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,"
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers."
I,IV,YORK,"O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,"
I,IV,YORK,"And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;"
I,IV,YORK,"And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,"
I,IV,YORK,"And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice"
I,IV,YORK,"Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!"
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"I will not bandy with thee word for word,"
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"I would prolong awhile the traitor's life."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland."
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"When he might spurn him with his foot away?"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"It is war's prize to take all vantages;"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And ten to one is no impeach of valour."
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin."
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"So doth the cony struggle in the net."
I,IV,YORK,"So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;"
I,IV,YORK,"So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd."
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What would your grace have done unto him now?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet parted but the shadow with his hand."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"What! was it you that would be England's king?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And made a preachment of your high descent?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where are your mess of sons to back you now?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Made issue from the bosom of the boy;"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if thine eyes can water for his death,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"I should lament thy miserable state."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And this is he was his adopted heir."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"But how is it that great Plantagenet"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"As I bethink me, you should not be king"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Till our King Henry had shook hands with death."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And rob his temples of the diadem,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now in his life, against your holy oath?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead."
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"That is my office, for my father's sake."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes."
I,IV,YORK,"She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,"
I,IV,YORK,"Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!"
I,IV,YORK,"How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex"
I,IV,YORK,"To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,"
I,IV,YORK,"Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!"
I,IV,YORK,"But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,"
I,IV,YORK,"Made impudent with use of evil deeds,"
I,IV,YORK,"I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush."
I,IV,YORK,"To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,"
I,IV,YORK,"Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless."
I,IV,YORK,"Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,"
I,IV,YORK,"Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,"
I,IV,YORK,"Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman."
I,IV,YORK,"Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?"
I,IV,YORK,"It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,"
I,IV,YORK,"Unless the adage must be verified,"
I,IV,YORK,"That beggars mounted run their horse to death."
I,IV,YORK,"'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;"
I,IV,YORK,"But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:"
I,IV,YORK,"'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;"
I,IV,YORK,"The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:"
I,IV,YORK,"'Tis government that makes them seem divine;"
I,IV,YORK,"The want thereof makes thee abominable:"
I,IV,YORK,"Thou art as opposite to every good"
I,IV,YORK,"As the Antipodes are unto us,"
I,IV,YORK,"Or as the south to the septentrion."
I,IV,YORK,"O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!"
I,IV,YORK,"How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,"
I,IV,YORK,"To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,"
I,IV,YORK,"And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?"
I,IV,YORK,"Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;"
I,IV,YORK,"Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless."
I,IV,YORK,"Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:"
I,IV,YORK,"Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:"
I,IV,YORK,"For raging wind blows up incessant showers,"
I,IV,YORK,"And when the rage allays, the rain begins."
I,IV,YORK,"These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:"
I,IV,YORK,"And every drop cries vengeance for his death,"
I,IV,YORK,"'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false"
I,IV,YORK,"Frenchwoman."
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears."
I,IV,YORK,"That face of his the hungry cannibals"
I,IV,YORK,"Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:"
I,IV,YORK,"But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,"
I,IV,YORK,"O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania."
I,IV,YORK,"See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:"
I,IV,YORK,"This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,"
I,IV,YORK,"And I with tears do wash the blood away."
I,IV,YORK,"Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:"
I,IV,YORK,"And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,"
I,IV,YORK,"Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;"
I,IV,YORK,"Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,"
I,IV,YORK,"And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'"
I,IV,YORK,"There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;"
I,IV,YORK,"And in thy need such comfort come to thee"
I,IV,YORK,"As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!"
I,IV,YORK,"Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:"
I,IV,YORK,"My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,"
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"I should not for my life but weep with him."
I,IV,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Think but upon the wrong he did us all,"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And that will quickly dry thy melting tears."
I,IV,CLIFFORD,"Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And here's to right our gentle-hearted king."
I,IV,YORK,"Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!"
I,IV,YORK,"My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Off with his head, and set it on York gates;"
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"So York may overlook the town of York."
I,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"3 KING HENRY VI"
II,I,EDWARD,"I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,"
II,I,EDWARD,"Or whether he be 'scaped away or no"
II,I,EDWARD,"From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:"
II,I,EDWARD,"Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;"
II,I,EDWARD,"Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;"
II,I,EDWARD,"Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard"
II,I,EDWARD,"The happy tidings of his good escape."
II,I,EDWARD,"How fares my brother? why is he so sad?"
II,I,RICHARD,"I cannot joy, until I be resolved"
II,I,RICHARD,"Where our right valiant father is become."
II,I,RICHARD,"I saw him in the battle range about;"
II,I,RICHARD,"And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth."
II,I,RICHARD,"Methought he bore him in the thickest troop"
II,I,RICHARD,"As doth a lion in a herd of neat;"
II,I,RICHARD,"Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,"
II,I,RICHARD,"Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,"
II,I,RICHARD,"The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him."
II,I,RICHARD,"So fared our father with his enemies;"
II,I,RICHARD,"So fled his enemies my warlike father:"
II,I,RICHARD,"Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son."
II,I,RICHARD,"See how the morning opes her golden gates,"
II,I,RICHARD,"And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!"
II,I,RICHARD,"How well resembles it the prime of youth,"
II,I,RICHARD,"Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!"
II,I,EDWARD,"Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?"
II,I,RICHARD,"Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;"
II,I,RICHARD,"Not separated with the racking clouds,"
II,I,RICHARD,"But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky."
II,I,RICHARD,"See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,"
II,I,RICHARD,"As if they vow'd some league inviolable:"
II,I,RICHARD,"Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun."
II,I,RICHARD,"In this the heaven figures some event."
II,I,EDWARD,"'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of."
II,I,EDWARD,"I think it cites us, brother, to the field,"
II,I,EDWARD,"That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,"
II,I,EDWARD,"Each one already blazing by our meeds,"
II,I,EDWARD,"Should notwithstanding join our lights together"
II,I,EDWARD,"And over-shine the earth as this the world."
II,I,EDWARD,"Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear"
II,I,EDWARD,"Upon my target three fair-shining suns."
II,I,RICHARD,"Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,"
II,I,RICHARD,"You love the breeder better than the male."
II,I,RICHARD,"But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell"
II,I,RICHARD,"Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?"
II,I,Messenger,"Ah, one that was a woful looker-on"
II,I,Messenger,"When as the noble Duke of York was slain,"
II,I,Messenger,"Your princely father and my loving lord!"
II,I,EDWARD,"O, speak no more, for I have heard too much."
II,I,RICHARD,"Say how he died, for I will hear it all."
II,I,Messenger,"Environed he was with many foes,"
II,I,Messenger,"And stood against them, as the hope of Troy"
II,I,Messenger,"Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy."
II,I,Messenger,"But Hercules himself must yield to odds;"
II,I,Messenger,"And many strokes, though with a little axe,"
II,I,Messenger,"Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak."
II,I,Messenger,"By many hands your father was subdued;"
II,I,Messenger,"But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm"
II,I,Messenger,"Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,"
II,I,Messenger,"Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,"
II,I,Messenger,"Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,"
II,I,Messenger,"The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks"
II,I,Messenger,"A napkin steeped in the harmless blood"
II,I,Messenger,"Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:"
II,I,Messenger,"And after many scorns, many foul taunts,"
II,I,Messenger,"They took his head, and on the gates of York"
II,I,Messenger,"They set the same; and there it doth remain,"
II,I,Messenger,"The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd."
II,I,EDWARD,"Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,"
II,I,EDWARD,"Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay."
II,I,EDWARD,"O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain"
II,I,EDWARD,"The flower of Europe for his chivalry;"
II,I,EDWARD,"And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,"
II,I,EDWARD,"For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee."
II,I,EDWARD,"Now my soul's palace is become a prison:"
II,I,EDWARD,"Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body"
II,I,EDWARD,"Might in the ground be closed up in rest!"
II,I,EDWARD,"For never henceforth shall I joy again,"
II,I,EDWARD,"Never, O never shall I see more joy!"
II,I,RICHARD,"I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture"
II,I,RICHARD,"Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:"
II,I,RICHARD,"Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;"
II,I,RICHARD,"For selfsame wind that I should speak withal"
II,I,RICHARD,"Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,"
II,I,RICHARD,"And burns me up with flames that tears would quench."
II,I,RICHARD,"To weep is to make less the depth of grief:"
II,I,RICHARD,"Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me"
II,I,RICHARD,"Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,"
II,I,RICHARD,"Or die renowned by attempting it."
II,I,EDWARD,"His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;"
II,I,EDWARD,"His dukedom and his chair with me is left."
II,I,RICHARD,"Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,"
II,I,RICHARD,"Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:"
II,I,RICHARD,"For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;"
II,I,RICHARD,"Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his."
II,I,WARWICK,"How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?"
II,I,RICHARD,"Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount"
II,I,RICHARD,"Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance"
II,I,RICHARD,"Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,"
II,I,RICHARD,"The words would add more anguish than the wounds."
II,I,RICHARD,"O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!"
II,I,EDWARD,"O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,"
II,I,EDWARD,"Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,"
II,I,EDWARD,"Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death."
II,I,WARWICK,"Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;"
II,I,WARWICK,"And now, to add more measure to your woes,"
II,I,WARWICK,"I come to tell you things sith then befall'n."
II,I,WARWICK,"After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Were brought me of your loss and his depart."
II,I,WARWICK,"I, then in London keeper of the king,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,"
II,I,WARWICK,"And very well appointed, as I thought,"
II,I,WARWICK,"March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Bearing the king in my behalf along;"
II,I,WARWICK,"For by my scouts I was advertised"
II,I,WARWICK,"That she was coming with a full intent"
II,I,WARWICK,"To dash our late decree in parliament"
II,I,WARWICK,"Touching King Henry's oath and your succession."
II,I,WARWICK,"Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met"
II,I,WARWICK,"Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:"
II,I,WARWICK,"But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,"
II,I,WARWICK,"That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;"
II,I,WARWICK,"Or whether 'twas report of her success;"
II,I,WARWICK,"Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Who thunders to his captives blood and death,"
II,I,WARWICK,"I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Their weapons like to lightning came and went;"
II,I,WARWICK,"Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Or like an idle thresher with a flail,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends."
II,I,WARWICK,"I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,"
II,I,WARWICK,"With promise of high pay and great rewards:"
II,I,WARWICK,"But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,"
II,I,WARWICK,"And we in them no hope to win the day;"
II,I,WARWICK,"So that we fled; the king unto the queen;"
II,I,WARWICK,"Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,"
II,I,WARWICK,"In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:"
II,I,WARWICK,"For in the marches here we heard you were,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Making another head to fight again."
II,I,EDWARD,"Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?"
II,I,EDWARD,"And when came George from Burgundy to England?"
II,I,WARWICK,"Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;"
II,I,WARWICK,"And for your brother, he was lately sent"
II,I,WARWICK,"From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,"
II,I,WARWICK,"With aid of soldiers to this needful war."
II,I,RICHARD,"'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:"
II,I,RICHARD,"Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,"
II,I,RICHARD,"But ne'er till now his scandal of retire."
II,I,WARWICK,"Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;"
II,I,WARWICK,"For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine"
II,I,WARWICK,"Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,"
II,I,WARWICK,"And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Were he as famous and as bold in war"
II,I,WARWICK,"As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer."
II,I,RICHARD,"I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:"
II,I,RICHARD,"'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak."
II,I,RICHARD,"But in this troublous time what's to be done?"
II,I,RICHARD,"Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,"
II,I,RICHARD,"And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,"
II,I,RICHARD,"Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?"
II,I,RICHARD,"Or shall we on the helmets of our foes"
II,I,RICHARD,"Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?"
II,I,RICHARD,"If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords."
II,I,WARWICK,"Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;"
II,I,WARWICK,"And therefore comes my brother Montague."
II,I,WARWICK,"Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,"
II,I,WARWICK,"With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,"
II,I,WARWICK,"And of their feather many more proud birds,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax."
II,I,WARWICK,"He swore consent to your succession,"
II,I,WARWICK,"His oath enrolled in the parliament;"
II,I,WARWICK,"And now to London all the crew are gone,"
II,I,WARWICK,"To frustrate both his oath and what beside"
II,I,WARWICK,"May make against the house of Lancaster."
II,I,WARWICK,"Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:"
II,I,WARWICK,"Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,"
II,I,WARWICK,"With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Why, Via! to London will we march amain,"
II,I,WARWICK,"And once again bestride our foaming steeds,"
II,I,WARWICK,"And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'"
II,I,WARWICK,"But never once again turn back and fly."
II,I,RICHARD,"Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:"
II,I,RICHARD,"Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,"
II,I,RICHARD,"That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay."
II,I,EDWARD,"Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;"
II,I,EDWARD,"And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--"
II,I,EDWARD,"Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!"
II,I,WARWICK,"No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:"
II,I,WARWICK,"The next degree is England's royal throne;"
II,I,WARWICK,"For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd"
II,I,WARWICK,"In every borough as we pass along;"
II,I,WARWICK,"And he that throws not up his cap for joy"
II,I,WARWICK,"Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head."
II,I,WARWICK,"King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,"
II,I,WARWICK,"Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,"
II,I,WARWICK,"But sound the trumpets, and about our task."
II,I,RICHARD,"Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,"
II,I,RICHARD,"As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,"
II,I,RICHARD,"I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine."
II,I,EDWARD,"Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!"
II,I,WARWICK,"How now! what news?"
II,I,Messenger,"The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,"
II,I,Messenger,"The queen is coming with a puissant host;"
II,I,Messenger,"And craves your company for speedy counsel."
II,I,WARWICK,"Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away."
II,I,WARWICK,"3 KING HENRY VI"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York."
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"To see this sight, it irks my very soul."
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"My gracious liege, this too much lenity"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"And harmful pity must be laid aside."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Not to the beast that would usurp their den."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Not his that spoils her young before her face."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Not he that sets his foot upon her back."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"He, but a duke, would have his son a king,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"And raise his issue, like a loving sire;"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Didst yield consent to disinherit him,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Which argued thee a most unloving father."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Unreasonable creatures feed their young;"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Yet, in protection of their tender ones,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Who hath not seen them, even with those wings"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Offer their own lives in their young's defence?"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Were it not pity that this goodly boy"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"And long hereafter say unto his child,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"My careless father fondly gave away'?"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"And let his manly face, which promiseth"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"To hold thine own and leave thine own with him."
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Inferring arguments of mighty force."
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"That things ill-got had ever bad success?"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"And happy always was it for that son"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"And would my father had left me no more!"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"For all the rest is held at such a rate"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Than in possession and jot of pleasure."
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"And this soft courage makes your followers faint."
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"You promised knighthood to our forward son:"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently."
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward, kneel down."
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right."
II,II,PRINCE,"My gracious father, by your kingly leave,"
II,II,PRINCE,"I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,"
II,II,PRINCE,"And in that quarrel use it to the death."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Why, that is spoken like a toward prince."
II,II,Messenger,"Royal commanders, be in readiness:"
II,II,Messenger,"For with a band of thirty thousand men"
II,II,Messenger,"Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;"
II,II,Messenger,"And in the towns, as they do march along,"
II,II,Messenger,"Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:"
II,II,Messenger,"Darraign your battle, for they are at hand."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"I would your highness would depart the field:"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"The queen hath best success when you are absent."
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune."
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay."
II,II,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Be it with resolution then to fight."
II,II,PRINCE EDWARD,"My royal father, cheer these noble lords"
II,II,PRINCE EDWARD,"And hearten those that fight in your defence:"
II,II,PRINCE EDWARD,"Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'"
II,II,EDWARD,"Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,"
II,II,EDWARD,"And set thy diadem upon my head;"
II,II,EDWARD,"Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?"
II,II,EDWARD,"I am his king, and he should bow his knee;"
II,II,EDWARD,"I was adopted heir by his consent:"
II,II,EDWARD,"Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,"
II,II,EDWARD,"You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,"
II,II,EDWARD,"Have caused him, by new act of parliament,"
II,II,EDWARD,"To blot out me, and put his own son in."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"And reason too:"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Who should succeed the father but the son?"
II,II,RICHARD,"Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Or any he the proudest of thy sort."
II,II,RICHARD,"'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied."
II,II,RICHARD,"For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight."
II,II,WARWICK,"What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Your legs did better service than your hands."
II,II,WARWICK,"Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"You said so much before, and yet you fled."
II,II,WARWICK,"'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence."
II,II,NORTHUMBERLAND,"No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay."
II,II,RICHARD,"Northumberland, I hold thee reverently."
II,II,RICHARD,"Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain"
II,II,RICHARD,"The execution of my big-swoln heart"
II,II,RICHARD,"Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?"
II,II,RICHARD,"Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,"
II,II,RICHARD,"As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;"
II,II,RICHARD,"But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed."
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak."
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips."
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:"
II,II,KING HENRY VI,"I am a king, and privileged to speak."
II,II,CLIFFORD,"My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here"
II,II,CLIFFORD,"Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still."
II,II,RICHARD,"Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:"
II,II,RICHARD,"By him that made us all, I am resolved"
II,II,RICHARD,"that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue."
II,II,EDWARD,"Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?"
II,II,EDWARD,"A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,"
II,II,EDWARD,"That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown."
II,II,WARWICK,"If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;"
II,II,WARWICK,"For York in justice puts his armour on."
II,II,PRINCE EDWARD,"If that be right which Warwick says is right,"
II,II,PRINCE EDWARD,"There is no wrong, but every thing is right."
II,II,RICHARD,"Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;"
II,II,RICHARD,"For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue."
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,"
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings."
II,II,RICHARD,"Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,"
II,II,RICHARD,"Whose father bears the title of a king,--"
II,II,RICHARD,"As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--"
II,II,RICHARD,"Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,"
II,II,RICHARD,"To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?"
II,II,EDWARD,"A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,"
II,II,EDWARD,"To make this shameless callet know herself."
II,II,EDWARD,"Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,"
II,II,EDWARD,"Although thy husband may be Menelaus;"
II,II,EDWARD,"And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd"
II,II,EDWARD,"By that false woman, as this king by thee."
II,II,EDWARD,"His father revell'd in the heart of France,"
II,II,EDWARD,"And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;"
II,II,EDWARD,"And had he match'd according to his state,"
II,II,EDWARD,"He might have kept that glory to this day;"
II,II,EDWARD,"But when he took a beggar to his bed,"
II,II,EDWARD,"And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,"
II,II,EDWARD,"Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,"
II,II,EDWARD,"That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,"
II,II,EDWARD,"And heap'd sedition on his crown at home."
II,II,EDWARD,"For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?"
II,II,EDWARD,"Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;"
II,II,EDWARD,"And we, in pity of the gentle king,"
II,II,EDWARD,"Had slipp'd our claim until another age."
II,II,GEORGE,"But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,"
II,II,GEORGE,"And that thy summer bred us no increase,"
II,II,GEORGE,"We set the axe to thy usurping root;"
II,II,GEORGE,"And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,"
II,II,GEORGE,"Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,"
II,II,GEORGE,"We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,"
II,II,GEORGE,"Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods."
II,II,EDWARD,"And, in this resolution, I defy thee;"
II,II,EDWARD,"Not willing any longer conference,"
II,II,EDWARD,"Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak."
II,II,EDWARD,"Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!"
II,II,EDWARD,"And either victory, or else a grave."
II,II,QUEEN MARGARET,"Stay, Edward."
II,II,EDWARD,"No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:"
II,II,EDWARD,"These words will cost ten thousand lives this day."
II,II,EDWARD,"3 KING HENRY VI"
II,III,WARWICK,"Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,"
II,III,WARWICK,"I lay me down a little while to breathe;"
II,III,WARWICK,"For strokes received, and many blows repaid,"
II,III,WARWICK,"Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,"
II,III,WARWICK,"And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile."
II,III,EDWARD,"Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!"
II,III,EDWARD,"For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded."
II,III,WARWICK,"How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?"
II,III,GEORGE,"Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;"
II,III,GEORGE,"Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:"
II,III,GEORGE,"What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?"
II,III,EDWARD,"Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;"
II,III,EDWARD,"And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit."
II,III,RICHARD,"Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?"
II,III,RICHARD,"Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,"
II,III,RICHARD,"Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;"
II,III,RICHARD,"And in the very pangs of death he cried,"
II,III,RICHARD,"Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,"
II,III,RICHARD,"'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'"
II,III,RICHARD,"So, underneath the belly of their steeds,"
II,III,RICHARD,"That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,"
II,III,RICHARD,"The noble gentleman gave up the ghost."
II,III,WARWICK,"Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:"
II,III,WARWICK,"I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly."
II,III,WARWICK,"Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,"
II,III,WARWICK,"Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;"
II,III,WARWICK,"And look upon, as if the tragedy"
II,III,WARWICK,"Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?"
II,III,WARWICK,"Here on my knee I vow to God above,"
II,III,WARWICK,"I'll never pause again, never stand still,"
II,III,WARWICK,"Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine"
II,III,WARWICK,"Or fortune given me measure of revenge."
II,III,EDWARD,"O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;"
II,III,EDWARD,"And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!"
II,III,EDWARD,"And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,"
II,III,EDWARD,"I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,"
II,III,EDWARD,"Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,"
II,III,EDWARD,"Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands"
II,III,EDWARD,"That to my foes this body must be prey,"
II,III,EDWARD,"Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,"
II,III,EDWARD,"And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!"
II,III,EDWARD,"Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,"
II,III,EDWARD,"Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth."
II,III,RICHARD,"Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,"
II,III,RICHARD,"Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:"
II,III,RICHARD,"I, that did never weep, now melt with woe"
II,III,RICHARD,"That winter should cut off our spring-time so."
II,III,WARWICK,"Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell."
II,III,GEORGE,"Yet let us all together to our troops,"
II,III,GEORGE,"And give them leave to fly that will not stay;"
II,III,GEORGE,"And call them pillars that will stand to us;"
II,III,GEORGE,"And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards"
II,III,GEORGE,"As victors wear at the Olympian games:"
II,III,GEORGE,"This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;"
II,III,GEORGE,"For yet is hope of life and victory."
II,III,GEORGE,"Forslow no longer, make we hence amain."
II,III,GEORGE,"3 KING HENRY VI"
II,IV,RICHARD,"Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:"
II,IV,RICHARD,"Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,"
II,IV,RICHARD,"And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,"
II,IV,RICHARD,"Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall."
II,IV,CLIFFORD,"Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:"
II,IV,CLIFFORD,"This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;"
II,IV,CLIFFORD,"And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;"
II,IV,CLIFFORD,"And here's the heart that triumphs in their death"
II,IV,CLIFFORD,"And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother"
II,IV,CLIFFORD,"To execute the like upon thyself;"
II,IV,CLIFFORD,"And so, have at thee!"
II,IV,RICHARD,"Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;"
II,IV,RICHARD,"For I myself will hunt this wolf to death."
II,IV,RICHARD,"3 KING HENRY VI"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"This battle fares like to the morning's war,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"When dying clouds contend with growing light,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Can neither call it perfect day nor night."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Forced to retire by fury of the wind:"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Now one the better, then another best;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So is the equal of this fell war."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Here on this molehill will I sit me down."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"To whom God will, there be the victory!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Have chid me from the battle; swearing both"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"They prosper best of all when I am thence."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"For what is in this world but grief and woe?"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"O God! methinks it were a happy life,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"To be no better than a homely swain;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"To sit upon a hill, as I do now,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Thereby to see the minutes how they run,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"How many make the hour full complete;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"How many hours bring about the day;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"How many days will finish up the year;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"How many years a mortal man may live."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"When this is known, then to divide the times:"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So many hours must I tend my flock;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So many hours must I take my rest;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So many hours must I contemplate;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So many hours must I sport myself;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So many days my ewes have been with young;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Pass'd over to the end they were created,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Is far beyond a prince's delicates,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"His viands sparkling in a golden cup,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"His body couched in a curious bed,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him."
II,V,Son,"Ill blows the wind that profits nobody."
II,V,Son,"This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,"
II,V,Son,"May be possessed with some store of crowns;"
II,V,Son,"And I, that haply take them from him now,"
II,V,Son,"May yet ere night yield both my life and them"
II,V,Son,"To some man else, as this dead man doth me."
II,V,Son,"Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,"
II,V,Son,"Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd."
II,V,Son,"O heavy times, begetting such events!"
II,V,Son,"From London by the king was I press'd forth;"
II,V,Son,"My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,"
II,V,Son,"Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;"
II,V,Son,"And I, who at his hands received my life, him"
II,V,Son,"Have by my hands of life bereaved him."
II,V,Son,"Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!"
II,V,Son,"And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!"
II,V,Son,"My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;"
II,V,Son,"And no more words till they have flow'd their fill."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief."
II,V,Father,"Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,"
II,V,Father,"Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:"
II,V,Father,"For I have bought it with an hundred blows."
II,V,Father,"But let me see: is this our foeman's face?"
II,V,Father,"Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!"
II,V,Father,"Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,"
II,V,Father,"Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,"
II,V,Father,"Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,"
II,V,Father,"Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!"
II,V,Father,"O, pity, God, this miserable age!"
II,V,Father,"What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,"
II,V,Father,"Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,"
II,V,Father,"This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!"
II,V,Father,"O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,"
II,V,Father,"And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"The red rose and the white are on his face,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"The fatal colours of our striving houses:"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"The one his purple blood right well resembles;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"If you contend, a thousand lives must wither."
II,V,Son,"How will my mother for a father's death"
II,V,Son,"Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!"
II,V,Father,"How will my wife for slaughter of my son"
II,V,Father,"Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"How will the country for these woful chances"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Misthink the king and not be satisfied!"
II,V,Son,"Was ever son so rued a father's death?"
II,V,Father,"Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much."
II,V,Son,"I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill."
II,V,Father,"These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;"
II,V,Father,"My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,"
II,V,Father,"For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;"
II,V,Father,"My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;"
II,V,Father,"And so obsequious will thy father be,"
II,V,Father,"Even for the loss of thee, having no more,"
II,V,Father,"As Priam was for all his valiant sons."
II,V,Father,"I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,"
II,V,Father,"For I have murdered where I should not kill."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Here sits a king more woful than you are."
II,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,"
II,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:"
II,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit."
II,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:"
II,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds"
II,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Having the fearful flying hare in sight,"
II,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,"
II,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,"
II,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain."
II,V,EXETER,"Away! for vengeance comes along with them:"
II,V,EXETER,"Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;"
II,V,EXETER,"Or else come after: I'll away before."
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Not that I fear to stay, but love to go"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!"
II,V,KING HENRY VI,"3 KING HENRY VI"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light."
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"More than my body's parting with my soul!"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"My love and fear glued many friends to thee;"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts."
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"The common people swarm like summer flies;"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"And who shines now but Henry's enemies?"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Or as thy father and his father did,"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Giving no ground unto the house of York,"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"They never then had sprung like summer flies;"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"I and ten thousand in this luckless realm"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Had left no mourning widows for our death;"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace."
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"The foe is merciless, and will not pity;"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"For at their hands I have deserved no pity."
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"The air hath got into my deadly wounds,"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"And much effuse of blood doth make me faint."
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;"
II,VI,CLIFFORD,"I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast."
II,VI,EDWARD,"Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks."
II,VI,EDWARD,"Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"That led calm Henry, though he were a king,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"Command an argosy to stem the waves."
II,VI,EDWARD,"But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?"
II,VI,WARWICK,"No, 'tis impossible he should escape,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"For, though before his face I speak the words"
II,VI,WARWICK,"Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:"
II,VI,WARWICK,"And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead."
II,VI,EDWARD,"Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?"
II,VI,RICHARD,"A deadly groan, like life and death's departing."
II,VI,EDWARD,"See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"If friend or foe, let him be gently used."
II,VI,RICHARD,"Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;"
II,VI,RICHARD,"Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch"
II,VI,RICHARD,"In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,"
II,VI,RICHARD,"But set his murdering knife unto the root"
II,VI,RICHARD,"From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,"
II,VI,RICHARD,"I mean our princely father, Duke of York."
II,VI,WARWICK,"From off the gates of York fetch down the head,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;"
II,VI,WARWICK,"Instead whereof let this supply the room:"
II,VI,WARWICK,"Measure for measure must be answered."
II,VI,EDWARD,"Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"That nothing sung but death to us and ours:"
II,VI,EDWARD,"Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak."
II,VI,WARWICK,"I think his understanding is bereft."
II,VI,WARWICK,"Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?"
II,VI,WARWICK,"Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"And he nor sees nor hears us what we say."
II,VI,RICHARD,"O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:"
II,VI,RICHARD,"'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,"
II,VI,RICHARD,"Because he would avoid such bitter taunts"
II,VI,RICHARD,"Which in the time of death he gave our father."
II,VI,GEORGE,"If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words."
II,VI,RICHARD,"Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace."
II,VI,EDWARD,"Clifford, repent in bootless penitence."
II,VI,WARWICK,"Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults."
II,VI,GEORGE,"While we devise fell tortures for thy faults."
II,VI,RICHARD,"Thou didst love York, and I am son to York."
II,VI,EDWARD,"Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee."
II,VI,GEORGE,"Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?"
II,VI,WARWICK,"They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont."
II,VI,RICHARD,"What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard"
II,VI,RICHARD,"When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath."
II,VI,RICHARD,"I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,"
II,VI,RICHARD,"If this right hand would buy two hour's life,"
II,VI,RICHARD,"That I in all despite might rail at him,"
II,VI,RICHARD,"This hand should chop it off, and with the"
II,VI,RICHARD,"issuing blood"
II,VI,RICHARD,"Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst"
II,VI,RICHARD,"York and young Rutland could not satisfy."
II,VI,WARWICK,"Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"And rear it in the place your father's stands."
II,VI,WARWICK,"And now to London with triumphant march,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"There to be crowned England's royal king:"
II,VI,WARWICK,"From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:"
II,VI,WARWICK,"So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;"
II,VI,WARWICK,"And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread"
II,VI,WARWICK,"The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;"
II,VI,WARWICK,"For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears."
II,VI,WARWICK,"First will I see the coronation;"
II,VI,WARWICK,"And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"To effect this marriage, so it please my lord."
II,VI,EDWARD,"Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;"
II,VI,EDWARD,"For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"And never will I undertake the thing"
II,VI,EDWARD,"Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting."
II,VI,EDWARD,"Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,"
II,VI,EDWARD,"Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best."
II,VI,RICHARD,"Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;"
II,VI,RICHARD,"For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous."
II,VI,WARWICK,"Tut, that's a foolish observation:"
II,VI,WARWICK,"Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,"
II,VI,WARWICK,"To see these honours in possession."
II,VI,WARWICK,"3 KING HENRY VI"
III,I,First Keeper,"Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;"
III,I,First Keeper,"For through this laund anon the deer will come;"
III,I,First Keeper,"And in this covert will we make our stand,"
III,I,First Keeper,"Culling the principal of all the deer."
III,I,Second Keeper,"I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot."
III,I,First Keeper,"That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow"
III,I,First Keeper,"Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost."
III,I,First Keeper,"Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:"
III,I,First Keeper,"And, for the time shall not seem tedious,"
III,I,First Keeper,"I'll tell thee what befell me on a day"
III,I,First Keeper,"In this self-place where now we mean to stand."
III,I,Second Keeper,"Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"To greet mine own land with my wishful sight."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"No humble suitors press to speak for right,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"No, not a man comes for redress of thee;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"For how can I help them, and not myself?"
III,I,First Keeper,"Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:"
III,I,First Keeper,"This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"For wise men say it is the wisest course."
III,I,Second Keeper,"Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him."
III,I,First Keeper,"Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"My queen and son are gone to France for aid;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"To wife for Edward: if this news be true,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"For Warwick is a subtle orator,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"By this account then Margaret may win him;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"For she's a woman to be pitied much:"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And Nero will be tainted with remorse,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And in conclusion wins the king from her,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"With promise of his sister, and what else,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"To strengthen and support King Edward's place."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!"
III,I,Second Keeper,"Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"More than I seem, and less than I was born to:"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"A man at least, for less I should not be;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And men may talk of kings, and why not I?"
III,I,Second Keeper,"Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough."
III,I,Second Keeper,"But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"My crown is in my heart, not on my head;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy."
III,I,Second Keeper,"Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,"
III,I,Second Keeper,"Your crown content and you must be contented"
III,I,Second Keeper,"To go along with us; for as we think,"
III,I,Second Keeper,"You are the king King Edward hath deposed;"
III,I,Second Keeper,"And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance"
III,I,Second Keeper,"Will apprehend you as his enemy."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"But did you never swear, and break an oath?"
III,I,Second Keeper,"No, never such an oath; nor will not now."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Where did you dwell when I was King of England?"
III,I,Second Keeper,"Here in this country, where we now remain."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"I was anointed king at nine months old;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"My father and my grandfather were kings,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And you were sworn true subjects unto me:"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?"
III,I,First Keeper,"No;"
III,I,First Keeper,"For we were subjects but while you were king."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Look, as I blow this feather from my face,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And as the air blows it to me again,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Obeying with my wind when I do blow,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And yielding to another when it blows,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Commanded always by the greater gust;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Such is the lightness of you common men."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"But do not break your oaths; for of that sin"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And be you kings, command, and I'll obey."
III,I,First Keeper,"We are true subjects to the king, King Edward."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"So would you be again to Henry,"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"If he were seated as King Edward is."
III,I,First Keeper,"We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,"
III,I,First Keeper,"To go with us unto the officers."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And what God will, that let your king perform;"
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"And what he will, I humbly yield unto."
III,I,KING HENRY VI,"3 KING HENRY VI"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"His lands then seized on by the conqueror:"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Her suit is now to repossess those lands;"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Which we in justice cannot well deny,"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Because in quarrel of the house of York"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"The worthy gentleman did lose his life."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"It were dishonour to deny it her."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"I see the lady hath a thing to grant,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Before the king will grant her humble suit."
III,II,CLARENCE,"he keeps the wind!"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Widow, we will consider of your suit;"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"And come some other time to know our mind."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:"
III,II,LADY GREY,"May it please your highness to resolve me now;"
III,II,LADY GREY,"And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"you all your lands,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"An if what pleases him shall pleasure you."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow."
III,II,CLARENCE,"chance to fall."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"take vantages."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"How many children hast thou, widow? tell me."
III,II,CLARENCE,"child of her."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"give her two."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Three, my most gracious lord."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"be ruled by him."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"you will have leave,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?"
III,II,LADY GREY,"Ay, full as dearly as I love myself."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"And would you not do much to do them good?"
III,II,LADY GREY,"To do them good, I would sustain some harm."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Then get your husband's lands, to do them good."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Therefore I came unto your majesty."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"I'll tell you how these lands are to be got."
III,II,LADY GREY,"So shall you bind me to your highness' service."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?"
III,II,LADY GREY,"What you command, that rests in me to do."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"But you will take exceptions to my boon."
III,II,LADY GREY,"No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Why, then I will do what your grace commands."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"wears the marble."
III,II,CLARENCE,"her wax must melt."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"An easy task; 'tis but to love a king."
III,II,LADY GREY,"That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee."
III,II,LADY GREY,"I take my leave with many thousand thanks."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"with a curtsy."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean."
III,II,LADY GREY,"The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?"
III,II,LADY GREY,"My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;"
III,II,LADY GREY,"That love which virtue begs and virtue grants."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"No, by my troth, I did not mean such love."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Why, then you mean not as I thought you did."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"But now you partly may perceive my mind."
III,II,LADY GREY,"My mind will never grant what I perceive"
III,II,LADY GREY,"Your highness aims at, if I aim aright."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee."
III,II,LADY GREY,"To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;"
III,II,LADY GREY,"For by that loss I will not purchase them."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Herein your highness wrongs both them and me."
III,II,LADY GREY,"But, mighty lord, this merry inclination"
III,II,LADY GREY,"Accords not with the sadness of my suit:"
III,II,LADY GREY,"Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand."
III,II,LADY GREY,"Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"knits her brows."
III,II,CLARENCE,"Christendom."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Her words do show her wit incomparable;"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"All her perfections challenge sovereignty:"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"One way or other, she is for a king;"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?"
III,II,LADY GREY,"'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:"
III,II,LADY GREY,"I am a subject fit to jest withal,"
III,II,LADY GREY,"But far unfit to be a sovereign."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"I speak no more than what my soul intends;"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"And that is, to enjoy thee for my love."
III,II,LADY GREY,"And that is more than I will yield unto:"
III,II,LADY GREY,"I know I am too mean to be your queen,"
III,II,LADY GREY,"And yet too good to be your concubine."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen."
III,II,LADY GREY,"'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"No more than when my daughters call thee mother."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"To be the father unto many sons."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"his shrift."
III,II,CLARENCE,"'twas for shift."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"You'll think it strange if I should marry her."
III,II,CLARENCE,"To whom, my lord?"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, Clarence, to myself."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"That would be ten days' wonder at the least."
III,II,CLARENCE,"That's a day longer than a wonder lasts."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"By so much is the wonder in extremes."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Her suit is granted for her husband's lands."
III,II,Nobleman,"My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,"
III,II,Nobleman,"And brought your prisoner to your palace gate."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,"
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"To question of his apprehension."
III,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, Edward will use women honourably."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"To cross me from the golden time I look for!"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And yet, between my soul's desire and me--"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"The lustful Edward's title buried--"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"A cold premeditation for my purpose!"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Like one that stands upon a promontory,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"So do I wish the crown, being so far off;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Flattering me with impossibilities."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Unless my hand and strength could equal them."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"What other pleasure can the world afford?"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And deck my body in gay ornaments,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"O miserable thought! and more unlikely"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"To make an envious mountain on my back,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Where sits deformity to mock my body;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"To shape my legs of an unequal size;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"To disproportion me in every part,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"That carries no impression like the dam."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And am I then a man to be beloved?"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"As are of better person than myself,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Be round impaled with a glorious crown."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And yet I know not how to get the crown,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"For many lives stand between me and home:"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Seeking a way and straying from the way;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Not knowing how to find the open air,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"But toiling desperately to find it out,--"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Torment myself to catch the English crown:"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And from that torment I will free myself,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Or hew my way out with a bloody axe."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And frame my face to all occasions."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And, like a Sinon, take another Troy."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"I can add colours to the chameleon,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"And set the murderous Machiavel to school."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?"
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down."
III,II,GLOUCESTER,"3 KING HENRY VI"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"No, mighty King of France: now Margaret"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where kings command. I was, I must confess,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Great Albion's queen in former golden days:"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"But now mischance hath trod my title down,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And with dishonour laid me on the ground;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And to my humble seat conform myself."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And sit thee by our side:"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Yield not thy neck"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Still ride in triumph over all mischance."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"It shall be eased, if France can yield relief."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"That Henry, sole possessor of my love,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is of a king become a banish'd man,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Usurps the regal title and the seat"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Of England's true-anointed lawful king."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our people and our peers are both misled,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"While we bethink a means to break it off."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"For this is he that moves both wind and tide."
III,III,WARWICK,"From worthy Edward, King of Albion,"
III,III,WARWICK,"My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,"
III,III,WARWICK,"I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,"
III,III,WARWICK,"First, to do greetings to thy royal person;"
III,III,WARWICK,"And then to crave a league of amity;"
III,III,WARWICK,"And lastly, to confirm that amity"
III,III,WARWICK,"With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant"
III,III,WARWICK,"That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,"
III,III,WARWICK,"To England's king in lawful marriage."
III,III,WARWICK,"I am commanded, with your leave and favour,"
III,III,WARWICK,"Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue"
III,III,WARWICK,"To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;"
III,III,WARWICK,"Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,"
III,III,WARWICK,"Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Before you answer Warwick. His demand"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"But from deceit bred by necessity;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"For how can tyrants safely govern home,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs."
III,III,WARWICK,"Injurious Margaret!"
III,III,PRINCE EDWARD,"And why not queen?"
III,III,WARWICK,"Because thy father Henry did usurp;"
III,III,WARWICK,"And thou no more are prince than she is queen."
III,III,OXFORD,"Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,"
III,III,OXFORD,"Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;"
III,III,OXFORD,"And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,"
III,III,OXFORD,"Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;"
III,III,OXFORD,"And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,"
III,III,OXFORD,"Who by his prowess conquered all France:"
III,III,OXFORD,"From these our Henry lineally descends."
III,III,WARWICK,"Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,"
III,III,WARWICK,"You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost"
III,III,WARWICK,"All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?"
III,III,WARWICK,"Methinks these peers of France should smile at that."
III,III,WARWICK,"But for the rest, you tell a pedigree"
III,III,WARWICK,"Of threescore and two years; a silly time"
III,III,WARWICK,"To make prescription for a kingdom's worth."
III,III,OXFORD,"Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,"
III,III,OXFORD,"Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,"
III,III,OXFORD,"And not bewray thy treason with a blush?"
III,III,WARWICK,"Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,"
III,III,WARWICK,"Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?"
III,III,WARWICK,"For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king."
III,III,OXFORD,"Call him my king by whose injurious doom"
III,III,OXFORD,"My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,"
III,III,OXFORD,"Was done to death? and more than so, my father,"
III,III,OXFORD,"Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,"
III,III,OXFORD,"When nature brought him to the door of death?"
III,III,OXFORD,"No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,"
III,III,OXFORD,"This arm upholds the house of Lancaster."
III,III,WARWICK,"And I the house of York."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"While I use further conference with Warwick."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Is Edward your true king? for I were loath"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"To link with him that were not lawful chosen."
III,III,WARWICK,"Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"But is he gracious in the people's eye?"
III,III,WARWICK,"The more that Henry was unfortunate."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Then further, all dissembling set aside,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Tell me for truth the measure of his love"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Unto our sister Bona."
III,III,WARWICK,"Such it seems"
III,III,WARWICK,"As may beseem a monarch like himself."
III,III,WARWICK,"Myself have often heard him say and swear"
III,III,WARWICK,"That this his love was an eternal plant,"
III,III,WARWICK,"Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,"
III,III,WARWICK,"The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,"
III,III,WARWICK,"Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,"
III,III,WARWICK,"Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve."
III,III,BONA,"Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:"
III,III,BONA,"Yet I confess that often ere this day,"
III,III,BONA,"When I have heard your king's desert recounted,"
III,III,BONA,"Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And now forthwith shall articles be drawn"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Touching the jointure that your king must make,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"That Bona shall be wife to the English king."
III,III,PRINCE EDWARD,"To Edward, but not to the English king."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"By this alliance to make void my suit:"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And still is friend to him and Margaret:"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"But if your title to the crown be weak,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"As may appear by Edward's good success,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Then 'tis but reason that I be released"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"From giving aid which late I promised."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"That your estate requires and mine can yield."
III,III,WARWICK,"Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,"
III,III,WARWICK,"Where having nothing, nothing can he lose."
III,III,WARWICK,"And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,"
III,III,WARWICK,"You have a father able to maintain you;"
III,III,WARWICK,"And better 'twere you troubled him than France."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Proud setter up and puller down of kings!"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"For both of you are birds of selfsame feather."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Warwick, this is some post to us or thee."
III,III,Post,"Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:"
III,III,Post,"These from our king unto your majesty:"
III,III,Post,"And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not."
III,III,OXFORD,"I like it well that our fair queen and mistress"
III,III,OXFORD,"Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his."
III,III,PRINCE EDWARD,"Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:"
III,III,PRINCE EDWARD,"I hope all's for the best."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys."
III,III,WARWICK,"Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"What! has your king married the Lady Grey!"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And now, to soothe your forgery and his,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"I told your majesty as much before:"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty."
III,III,WARWICK,"King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,"
III,III,WARWICK,"And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,"
III,III,WARWICK,"That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,"
III,III,WARWICK,"No more my king, for he dishonours me,"
III,III,WARWICK,"But most himself, if he could see his shame."
III,III,WARWICK,"Did I forget that by the house of York"
III,III,WARWICK,"My father came untimely to his death?"
III,III,WARWICK,"Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?"
III,III,WARWICK,"Did I impale him with the regal crown?"
III,III,WARWICK,"Did I put Henry from his native right?"
III,III,WARWICK,"And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?"
III,III,WARWICK,"Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:"
III,III,WARWICK,"And to repair my honour lost for him,"
III,III,WARWICK,"I here renounce him and return to Henry."
III,III,WARWICK,"My noble queen, let former grudges pass,"
III,III,WARWICK,"And henceforth I am thy true servitor:"
III,III,WARWICK,"I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,"
III,III,WARWICK,"And replant Henry in his former state."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I forgive and quite forget old faults,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend."
III,III,WARWICK,"So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,"
III,III,WARWICK,"That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us"
III,III,WARWICK,"With some few bands of chosen soldiers,"
III,III,WARWICK,"I'll undertake to land them on our coast"
III,III,WARWICK,"And force the tyrant from his seat by war."
III,III,WARWICK,"'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:"
III,III,WARWICK,"And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,"
III,III,WARWICK,"He's very likely now to fall from him,"
III,III,WARWICK,"For matching more for wanton lust than honour,"
III,III,WARWICK,"Or than for strength and safety of our country."
III,III,BONA,"Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged"
III,III,BONA,"But by thy help to this distressed queen?"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?"
III,III,BONA,"My quarrel and this English queen's are one."
III,III,WARWICK,"And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Therefore at last I firmly am resolved"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"You shall have aid."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Let me give humble thanks for all at once."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Then, England's messenger, return in post,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"That Lewis of France is sending over masquers"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"To revel it with him and his new bride:"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal."
III,III,BONA,"Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,"
III,III,BONA,"I'll wear the willow garland for his sake."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I am ready to put armour on."
III,III,WARWICK,"Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,"
III,III,WARWICK,"And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long."
III,III,WARWICK,"There's thy reward: be gone."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"But, Warwick,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And, as occasion serves, this noble queen"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And prince shall follow with a fresh supply."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?"
III,III,WARWICK,"This shall assure my constant loyalty,"
III,III,WARWICK,"That if our queen and this young prince agree,"
III,III,WARWICK,"I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy"
III,III,WARWICK,"To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion."
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,"
III,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine."
III,III,PRINCE EDWARD,"Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;"
III,III,PRINCE EDWARD,"And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet."
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,"
III,III,KING LEWIS XI,"For mocking marriage with a dame of France."
III,III,WARWICK,"I came from Edward as ambassador,"
III,III,WARWICK,"But I return his sworn and mortal foe:"
III,III,WARWICK,"Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,"
III,III,WARWICK,"But dreadful war shall answer his demand."
III,III,WARWICK,"Had he none else to make a stale but me?"
III,III,WARWICK,"Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow."
III,III,WARWICK,"I was the chief that raised him to the crown,"
III,III,WARWICK,"And I'll be chief to bring him down again:"
III,III,WARWICK,"Not that I pity Henry's misery,"
III,III,WARWICK,"But seek revenge on Edward's mockery."
III,III,WARWICK,"3 KING HENRY VI"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"How could he stay till Warwick made return?"
IV,I,SOMERSET,"My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And his well-chosen bride."
IV,I,CLARENCE,"I mind to tell him plainly what I think."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Which are so weak of courage and in judgment"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"That they'll take no offence at our abuse."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Suppose they take offence without a cause,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And shall have your will, because our king:"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Not I:"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"To sunder them that yoke so well together."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Should not become my wife and England's queen."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And you too, Somerset and Montague,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Speak freely what you think."
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Becomes your enemy, for mocking him"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"About the marriage of the Lady Bona."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Is now dishonoured by this new marriage."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"By such invention as I can devise?"
IV,I,MONTAGUE,"Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance"
IV,I,MONTAGUE,"Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth"
IV,I,MONTAGUE,"'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage."
IV,I,HASTINGS,"Why, knows not Montague that of itself"
IV,I,HASTINGS,"England is safe, if true within itself?"
IV,I,MONTAGUE,"But the safer when 'tis back'd with France."
IV,I,HASTINGS,"'Tis better using France than trusting France:"
IV,I,HASTINGS,"Let us be back'd with God and with the seas"
IV,I,HASTINGS,"Which He hath given for fence impregnable,"
IV,I,HASTINGS,"And with their helps only defend ourselves;"
IV,I,HASTINGS,"In them and in ourselves our safety lies."
IV,I,CLARENCE,"For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And for this once my will shall stand for law."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Unto the brother of your loving bride;"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"She better would have fitted me or Clarence:"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"But in your bride you bury brotherhood."
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee."
IV,I,CLARENCE,"In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Which being shallow, you give me leave"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"To play the broker in mine own behalf;"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"And to that end I shortly mind to leave you."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And not be tied unto his brother's will."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My lords, before it pleased his majesty"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To raise my state to title of a queen,"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Do me but right, and you must all confess"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That I was not ignoble of descent;"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And meaner than myself have had like fortune."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But as this title honours me and mine,"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"So long as Edward is thy constant friend,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, messenger, what letters or what news"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"From France?"
IV,I,Post,"My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,"
IV,I,Post,"But such as I, without your special pardon,"
IV,I,Post,"Dare not relate."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?"
IV,I,Post,"At my depart, these were his very words:"
IV,I,Post,"'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,"
IV,I,Post,"That Lewis of France is sending over masquers"
IV,I,Post,"To revel it with him and his new bride.'"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?"
IV,I,Post,"These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:"
IV,I,Post,"'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,"
IV,I,Post,"I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"I blame not her, she could say little less;"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"For I have heard that she was there in place."
IV,I,Post,"'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,"
IV,I,Post,"And I am ready to put armour on.'"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Belike she minds to play the Amazon."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"But what said Warwick to these injuries?"
IV,I,Post,"He, more incensed against your majesty"
IV,I,Post,"Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:"
IV,I,Post,"'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,"
IV,I,Post,"And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"They shall have wars and pay for their presumption."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?"
IV,I,Post,"Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in"
IV,I,Post,"friendship"
IV,I,Post,"That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter."
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger."
IV,I,CLARENCE,"Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage"
IV,I,CLARENCE,"I may not prove inferior to yourself."
IV,I,CLARENCE,"You that love me and Warwick, follow me."
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"My thoughts aim at a further matter; I"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And haste is needful in this desperate case."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Go levy men, and make prepare for war;"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"They are already, or quickly will be landed:"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Myself in person will straight follow you."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"If it be so, then both depart to him;"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"But if you mind to hold your true obedience,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Give me assurance with some friendly vow,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"That I may never have you in suspect."
IV,I,MONTAGUE,"So God help Montague as he proves true!"
IV,I,HASTINGS,"And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?"
IV,I,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, so! then am I sure of victory."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,"
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power."
IV,I,KING EDWARD IV,"3 KING HENRY VI"
IV,II,WARWICK,"Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;"
IV,II,WARWICK,"The common people by numbers swarm to us."
IV,II,WARWICK,"But see where Somerset and Clarence come!"
IV,II,WARWICK,"Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?"
IV,II,CLARENCE,"Fear not that, my lord."
IV,II,WARWICK,"Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;"
IV,II,WARWICK,"And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice"
IV,II,WARWICK,"To rest mistrustful where a noble heart"
IV,II,WARWICK,"Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;"
IV,II,WARWICK,"Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:"
IV,II,WARWICK,"But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine."
IV,II,WARWICK,"And now what rests but, in night's coverture,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"His soldiers lurking in the towns about,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"And but attended by a simple guard,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?"
IV,II,WARWICK,"Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:"
IV,II,WARWICK,"That as Ulysses and stout Diomede"
IV,II,WARWICK,"With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"At unawares may beat down Edward's guard"
IV,II,WARWICK,"And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"For I intend but only to surprise him."
IV,II,WARWICK,"You that will follow me to this attempt,"
IV,II,WARWICK,"Applaud the name of Henry with your leader."
IV,II,WARWICK,"Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:"
IV,II,WARWICK,"For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!"
IV,II,WARWICK,"3 KING HENRY VI"
IV,III,First Watchman,"Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:"
IV,III,First Watchman,"The king by this is set him down to sleep."
IV,III,Second Watchman,"What, will he not to bed?"
IV,III,First Watchman,"Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow"
IV,III,First Watchman,"Never to lie and take his natural rest"
IV,III,First Watchman,"Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd."
IV,III,Second Watchman,"To-morrow then belike shall be the day,"
IV,III,Second Watchman,"If Warwick be so near as men report."
IV,III,Third Watchman,"But say, I pray, what nobleman is that"
IV,III,Third Watchman,"That with the king here resteth in his tent?"
IV,III,First Watchman,"'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend."
IV,III,Third Watchman,"O, is it so? But why commands the king"
IV,III,Third Watchman,"That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,"
IV,III,Third Watchman,"While he himself keeps in the cold field?"
IV,III,Second Watchman,"'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous."
IV,III,Third Watchman,"Ay, but give me worship and quietness;"
IV,III,Third Watchman,"I like it better than a dangerous honour."
IV,III,Third Watchman,"If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,"
IV,III,Third Watchman,"'Tis to be doubted he would waken him."
IV,III,First Watchman,"Unless our halberds did shut up his passage."
IV,III,Second Watchman,"Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,"
IV,III,Second Watchman,"But to defend his person from night-foes?"
IV,III,WARWICK,"This is his tent; and see where stand his guard."
IV,III,WARWICK,"Courage, my masters! honour now or never!"
IV,III,WARWICK,"But follow me, and Edward shall be ours."
IV,III,First Watchman,"Who goes there?"
IV,III,Second Watchman,"Stay, or thou diest!"
IV,III,SOMERSET,"What are they that fly there?"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke."
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,"
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Thou call'dst me king."
IV,III,WARWICK,"Ay, but the case is alter'd:"
IV,III,WARWICK,"When you disgraced me in my embassade,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Then I degraded you from being king,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"And come now to create you Duke of York."
IV,III,WARWICK,"Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"That know not how to use ambassadors,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Nor how to be contented with one wife,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Nor how to study for the people's welfare,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?"
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?"
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down."
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,"
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Of thee thyself and all thy complices,"
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Edward will always bear himself as king:"
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,"
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel."
IV,III,WARWICK,"Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:"
IV,III,WARWICK,"But Henry now shall wear the English crown,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow."
IV,III,WARWICK,"My Lord of Somerset, at my request,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Unto my brother, Archbishop of York."
IV,III,WARWICK,"When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,"
IV,III,WARWICK,"I'll follow you, and tell what answer"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him."
IV,III,WARWICK,"Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York."
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"What fates impose, that men must needs abide;"
IV,III,KING EDWARD IV,"It boots not to resist both wind and tide."
IV,III,OXFORD,"What now remains, my lords, for us to do"
IV,III,OXFORD,"But march to London with our soldiers?"
IV,III,WARWICK,"Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;"
IV,III,WARWICK,"To free King Henry from imprisonment"
IV,III,WARWICK,"And see him seated in the regal throne."
IV,III,WARWICK,"3 KING HENRY VI"
IV,IV,RIVERS,"Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?"
IV,IV,RIVERS,"What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"No, but the loss of his own royal person."
IV,IV,RIVERS,"Then is my sovereign slain?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Or by his foe surprised at unawares:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And, as I further have to understand,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Is new committed to the Bishop of York,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe."
IV,IV,RIVERS,"These news I must confess are full of grief;"
IV,IV,RIVERS,"Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:"
IV,IV,RIVERS,"Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And I the rather wean me from despair"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"This is it that makes me bridle passion"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown."
IV,IV,RIVERS,"But, madam, where is Warwick then become?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I am inform'd that he comes towards London,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To set the crown once more on Henry's head:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To save at least the heir of Edward's right:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"There shall I rest secure from force and fraud."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If Warwick take us we are sure to die."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"3 KING HENRY VI"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Into this chiefest thicket of the park."
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"He hath good usage and great liberty,"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"And, often but attended with weak guard,"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Comes hunting this way to disport himself."
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"I have advertised him by secret means"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"That if about this hour he make his way"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Under the colour of his usual game,"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"He shall here find his friends with horse and men"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"To set him free from his captivity."
IV,V,Huntsman,"This way, my lord; for this way lies the game."
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand."
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,"
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, the time and case requireth haste:"
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Your horse stands ready at the park-corner."
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"But whither shall we then?"
IV,V,HASTINGS,"To Lynn, my lord,"
IV,V,HASTINGS,"And ship from thence to Flanders."
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning."
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness."
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk."
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?"
IV,V,Huntsman,"Better do so than tarry and be hang'd."
IV,V,GLOUCESTER,"Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado."
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;"
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"And pray that I may repossess the crown."
IV,V,KING EDWARD IV,"3 KING HENRY VI"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Master lieutenant, now that God and friends"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And turn'd my captive state to liberty,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"At our enlargement what are thy due fees?"
IV,VI,Lieutenant,"Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;"
IV,VI,Lieutenant,"But if an humble prayer may prevail,"
IV,VI,Lieutenant,"I then crave pardon of your majesty."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"For what, lieutenant? for well using me?"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Conceive when after many moody thoughts"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"At last by notes of household harmony"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"They quite forget their loss of liberty."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"He was the author, thou the instrument."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And that the people of this blessed land"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"I here resign my government to thee,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"And now may seem as wise as virtuous,"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"For few men rightly temper with the stars:"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"For choosing me when Clarence is in place."
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,"
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"To whom the heavens in thy nativity"
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,"
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"As likely to be blest in peace and war;"
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"And therefore I yield thee my free consent."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"And I choose Clarence only for protector."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"That no dissension hinder government:"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"I make you both protectors of this land,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"While I myself will lead a private life"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And in devotion spend my latter days,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?"
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;"
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"For on thy fortune I repose myself."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"We'll yoke together, like a double shadow"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"To Henry's body, and supply his place;"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"I mean, in bearing weight of government,"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"While he enjoys the honour and his ease."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"And all his lands and goods be confiscate."
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"What else? and that succession be determined."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"But, with the first of all your chief affairs,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Let me entreat, for I command no more,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"That Margaret your queen and my son Edward"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Be sent for, to return from France with speed;"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"My joy of liberty is half eclipsed."
IV,VI,CLARENCE,"It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Of whom you seem to have so tender care?"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Come hither, England's hope."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"If secret powers"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"His looks are full of peaceful majesty,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"His head by nature framed to wear a crown,"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Likely in time to bless a regal throne."
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Make much of him, my lords, for this is he"
IV,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Must help you more than you are hurt by me."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"What news, my friend?"
IV,VI,Post,"That Edward is escaped from your brother,"
IV,VI,Post,"And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?"
IV,VI,Post,"He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester"
IV,VI,Post,"And the Lord Hastings, who attended him"
IV,VI,Post,"In secret ambush on the forest side"
IV,VI,Post,"And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;"
IV,VI,Post,"For hunting was his daily exercise."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"My brother was too careless of his charge."
IV,VI,WARWICK,"But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide"
IV,VI,WARWICK,"A salve for any sore that may betide."
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"And we shall have more wars before 't be long."
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"As Henry's late presaging prophecy"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"What may befall him, to his harm and ours:"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,"
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"Till storms be past of civil enmity."
IV,VI,OXFORD,"Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,"
IV,VI,OXFORD,"'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down."
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"It shall be so; he shall to Brittany."
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"Come, therefore, let's about it speedily."
IV,VI,SOMERSET,"3 KING HENRY VI"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"And says that once more I shall interchange"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"My waned state for Henry's regal crown."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"And brought desired help from Burgundy:"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"What then remains, we being thus arrived"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"But that we enter, as into our dukedom?"
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;"
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"For many men that stumble at the threshold"
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Are well foretold that danger lurks within."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"By fair or foul means we must enter in,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"For hither will our friends repair to us."
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them."
IV,VII,Mayor,"My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,"
IV,VII,Mayor,"And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;"
IV,VII,Mayor,"For now we owe allegiance unto Henry."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York."
IV,VII,Mayor,"True, my good lord; I know you for no less."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"As being well content with that alone."
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"He'll soon find means to make the body follow."
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?"
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends."
IV,VII,Mayor,"Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd."
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!"
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"The good old man would fain that all were well,"
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,"
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade"
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"Both him and all his brothers unto reason."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"But in the night or in the time of war."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"For Edward will defend the town and thee,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"And all those friends that deign to follow me."
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,"
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"To help King Edward in his time of storm,"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"As every loyal subject ought to do."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Our title to the crown and only claim"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Our dukedom till God please to send the rest."
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"Then fare you well, for I will hence again:"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"I came to serve a king and not a duke."
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"Drummer, strike up, and let us march away."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"By what safe means the crown may be recover'd."
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"What talk you of debating? in few words,"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"To keep them back that come to succor you:"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?"
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning."
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule."
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns."
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:"
IV,VII,GLOUCESTER,"The bruit thereof will bring you many friends."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"And Henry but usurps the diadem."
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"And now will I be Edward's champion."
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:"
IV,VII,HASTINGS,"Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation."
IV,VII,Soldier,"Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of"
IV,VII,Soldier,"England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c."
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,"
IV,VII,MONTAGUE,"By this I challenge him to single fight."
IV,VII,All,"Long live Edward the Fourth!"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"And when the morning sun shall raise his car"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Above the border of this horizon,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"For well I wot that Henry is no soldier."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,"
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay."
IV,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"3 KING HENRY VI"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"And with his troops doth march amain to London;"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"And many giddy people flock to him."
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Let's levy men, and beat him back again."
IV,VIII,CLARENCE,"A little fire is quickly trodden out;"
IV,VIII,CLARENCE,"Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench."
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends."
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"My sovereign, with the loving citizens,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Like to his island girt in with the ocean,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,"
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Shall rest in London till we come to him."
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply."
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Farewell, my sovereign."
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope."
IV,VIII,CLARENCE,"In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand."
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!"
IV,VIII,MONTAGUE,"Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave."
IV,VIII,OXFORD,"And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu."
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"And all at once, once more a happy farewell."
IV,VIII,WARWICK,"Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry."
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Here at the palace I will rest awhile."
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Methinks the power that Edward hath in field"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Should not be able to encounter mine."
IV,VIII,EXETER,"The doubt is that he will seduce the rest."
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"I have not been desirous of their wealth,"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies."
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"Then why should they love Edward more than me?"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,"
IV,VIII,KING HENRY VI,"The lamb will never cease to follow him."
IV,VIII,EXETER,"Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?"
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;"
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"And once again proclaim us King of England."
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:"
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,"
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"And swell so much the higher by their ebb."
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak."
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course"
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"Where peremptory Warwick now remains:"
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,"
IV,VIII,KING EDWARD IV,"Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay."
IV,VIII,GLOUCESTER,"Away betimes, before his forces join,"
IV,VIII,GLOUCESTER,"And take the great-grown traitor unawares:"
IV,VIII,GLOUCESTER,"Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry."
IV,VIII,GLOUCESTER,"3 KING HENRY VI"
V,I,WARWICK,"Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?"
V,I,WARWICK,"How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?"
V,I,First Messenger,"By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward."
V,I,WARWICK,"How far off is our brother Montague?"
V,I,WARWICK,"Where is the post that came from Montague?"
V,I,Second Messenger,"By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop."
V,I,WARWICK,"Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?"
V,I,WARWICK,"And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?"
V,I,SOMERSET,"At Southam I did leave him with his forces,"
V,I,SOMERSET,"And do expect him here some two hours hence."
V,I,WARWICK,"Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum."
V,I,SOMERSET,"It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:"
V,I,SOMERSET,"The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick."
V,I,WARWICK,"Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends."
V,I,SOMERSET,"They are at hand, and you shall quickly know."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle."
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!"
V,I,WARWICK,"O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?"
V,I,WARWICK,"Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,"
V,I,WARWICK,"That we could hear no news of his repair?"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And he shall pardon thee these outrages."
V,I,WARWICK,"Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,"
V,I,WARWICK,"Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,"
V,I,WARWICK,"Call Warwick patron and be penitent?"
V,I,WARWICK,"And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York."
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"I thought, at least, he would have said the king;"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Or did he make the jest against his will?"
V,I,WARWICK,"Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"I'll do thee service for so good a gift."
V,I,WARWICK,"'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift."
V,I,WARWICK,"Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:"
V,I,WARWICK,"And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;"
V,I,WARWICK,"And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"What is the body when the head is off?"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"The king was slily finger'd from the deck!"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower."
V,I,EDWARD,"'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still."
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools."
V,I,WARWICK,"I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,"
V,I,WARWICK,"And with the other fling it at thy face,"
V,I,WARWICK,"Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'"
V,I,WARWICK,"O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!"
V,I,OXFORD,"Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"The gates are open, let us enter too."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"So other foes may set upon our backs."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Stand we in good array; for they no doubt"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Will issue out again and bid us battle:"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"If not, the city being but of small defence,"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same."
V,I,WARWICK,"O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help."
V,I,MONTAGUE,"Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"The harder match'd, the greater victory:"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"My mind presageth happy gain and conquest."
V,I,SOMERSET,"Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Have sold their lives unto the house of York;"
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold."
V,I,WARWICK,"And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,"
V,I,WARWICK,"Of force enough to bid his brother battle;"
V,I,WARWICK,"With whom an upright zeal to right prevails"
V,I,WARWICK,"More than the nature of a brother's love!"
V,I,WARWICK,"Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call."
V,I,CLARENCE,"Father of Warwick, know you what this means?"
V,I,CLARENCE,"Look here, I throw my infamy at thee"
V,I,CLARENCE,"I will not ruinate my father's house,"
V,I,CLARENCE,"Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,"
V,I,CLARENCE,"And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,"
V,I,CLARENCE,"That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,"
V,I,CLARENCE,"To bend the fatal instruments of war"
V,I,CLARENCE,"Against his brother and his lawful king?"
V,I,CLARENCE,"Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:"
V,I,CLARENCE,"To keep that oath were more impiety"
V,I,CLARENCE,"Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter."
V,I,CLARENCE,"I am so sorry for my trespass made"
V,I,CLARENCE,"That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,"
V,I,CLARENCE,"I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,"
V,I,CLARENCE,"With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--"
V,I,CLARENCE,"As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--"
V,I,CLARENCE,"To plague thee for thy foul misleading me."
V,I,CLARENCE,"And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,"
V,I,CLARENCE,"And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks."
V,I,CLARENCE,"Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:"
V,I,CLARENCE,"And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,"
V,I,CLARENCE,"For I will henceforth be no more unconstant."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate."
V,I,GLOUCESTER,"Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike."
V,I,WARWICK,"O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?"
V,I,WARWICK,"Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!"
V,I,WARWICK,"I will away towards Barnet presently,"
V,I,WARWICK,"And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way."
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!"
V,I,KING EDWARD IV,"3 KING HENRY VI"
V,II,KING EDWARD IV,"So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;"
V,II,KING EDWARD IV,"For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all."
V,II,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,"
V,II,KING EDWARD IV,"That Warwick's bones may keep thine company."
V,II,WARWICK,"Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,"
V,II,WARWICK,"And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?"
V,II,WARWICK,"Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,"
V,II,WARWICK,"My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows."
V,II,WARWICK,"That I must yield my body to the earth"
V,II,WARWICK,"And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe."
V,II,WARWICK,"Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,"
V,II,WARWICK,"Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,"
V,II,WARWICK,"Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,"
V,II,WARWICK,"Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree"
V,II,WARWICK,"And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind."
V,II,WARWICK,"These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,"
V,II,WARWICK,"Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,"
V,II,WARWICK,"To search the secret treasons of the world:"
V,II,WARWICK,"The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,"
V,II,WARWICK,"Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;"
V,II,WARWICK,"For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?"
V,II,WARWICK,"And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?"
V,II,WARWICK,"Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!"
V,II,WARWICK,"My parks, my walks, my manors that I had."
V,II,WARWICK,"Even now forsake me, and of all my lands"
V,II,WARWICK,"Is nothing left me but my body's length."
V,II,WARWICK,"Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?"
V,II,WARWICK,"And, live we how we can, yet die we must."
V,II,SOMERSET,"Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are."
V,II,SOMERSET,"We might recover all our loss again;"
V,II,SOMERSET,"The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:"
V,II,SOMERSET,"Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!"
V,II,WARWICK,"Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,"
V,II,WARWICK,"If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand."
V,II,WARWICK,"And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!"
V,II,WARWICK,"Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,"
V,II,WARWICK,"Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood"
V,II,WARWICK,"That glues my lips and will not let me speak."
V,II,WARWICK,"Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead."
V,II,SOMERSET,"Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;"
V,II,SOMERSET,"And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,"
V,II,SOMERSET,"And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'"
V,II,SOMERSET,"And more he would have said, and more he spoke,"
V,II,SOMERSET,"Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,"
V,II,SOMERSET,"That mought not be distinguished; but at last"
V,II,SOMERSET,"I well might hear, delivered with a groan,"
V,II,SOMERSET,"'O, farewell, Warwick!'"
V,II,WARWICK,"Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;"
V,II,WARWICK,"For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven."
V,II,OXFORD,"Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!"
V,II,OXFORD,"3 KING HENRY VI"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"And we are graced with wreaths of victory."
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"That will encounter with our glorious sun,"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Ere he attain his easeful western bed:"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"And, as we hear, march on to fight with us."
V,III,CLARENCE,"A little gale will soon disperse that cloud"
V,III,CLARENCE,"And blow it to the source from whence it came:"
V,III,CLARENCE,"The very beams will dry those vapours up,"
V,III,CLARENCE,"For every cloud engenders not a storm."
V,III,GLOUCESTER,"The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,"
V,III,GLOUCESTER,"And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:"
V,III,GLOUCESTER,"If she have time to breathe be well assured"
V,III,GLOUCESTER,"Her faction will be full as strong as ours."
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"We are advertised by our loving friends"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"We, having now the best at Barnet field,"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"And, as we march, our strength will be augmented"
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"In every county as we go along."
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away."
V,III,KING EDWARD IV,"3 KING HENRY VI"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"But cheerly seek how to redress their harms."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"What though the mast be now blown overboard,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"With tearful eyes add water to the sea"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And give more strength to that which hath too much,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Which industry and courage might have saved?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And Montague our topmost; what of him?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And Somerset another goodly mast?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"We will not from the helm to sit and weep,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"As good to chide the waves as speak them fair."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And what is Edward but ruthless sea?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"All these the enemies to our poor bark."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or else you famish; that's a threefold death."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"This speak I, lords, to let you understand,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"If case some one of you would fly from us,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear."
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit"
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,"
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"Infuse his breast with magnanimity"
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"And make him, naked, foil a man at arms."
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"I speak not this as doubting any here"
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"For did I but suspect a fearful man"
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"He should have leave to go away betimes,"
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"Lest in our need he might infect another"
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"And make him of like spirit to himself."
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"If any such be here--as God forbid!--"
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"Let him depart before we need his help."
V,IV,OXFORD,"Women and children of so high a courage,"
V,IV,OXFORD,"And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame."
V,IV,OXFORD,"O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather"
V,IV,OXFORD,"Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live"
V,IV,OXFORD,"To bear his image and renew his glories!"
V,IV,SOMERSET,"And he that will not fight for such a hope."
V,IV,SOMERSET,"Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,"
V,IV,SOMERSET,"If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks."
V,IV,PRINCE EDWARD,"And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else."
V,IV,Messenger,"Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand."
V,IV,Messenger,"Ready to fight; therefore be resolute."
V,IV,OXFORD,"I thought no less: it is his policy"
V,IV,OXFORD,"To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided."
V,IV,SOMERSET,"But he's deceived; we are in readiness."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness."
V,IV,OXFORD,"Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge."
V,IV,KING EDWARD IV,"Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,"
V,IV,KING EDWARD IV,"Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,"
V,IV,KING EDWARD IV,"Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night."
V,IV,KING EDWARD IV,"I need not add more fuel to your fire,"
V,IV,KING EDWARD IV,"For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out"
V,IV,KING EDWARD IV,"Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,"
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Be valiant and give signal to the fight."
V,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"3 KING HENRY VI"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Now here a period of tumultuous broils."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"For Somerset, off with his guilty head."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak."
V,V,OXFORD,"For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words."
V,V,SOMERSET,"Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"So part we sadly in this troublous world,"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Shall have a high reward, and he his life?"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"That you might still have worn the petticoat,"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster."
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"His currish riddles sort not with this place."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"For God's sake, take away this captive scold."
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue."
V,V,CLARENCE,"Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert."
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"I know my duty; you are all undutiful:"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"I am your better, traitors as ye are:"
V,V,PRINCE EDWARD,"And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Take that, thou likeness of this railer here."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony."
V,V,CLARENCE,"And there's for twitting me with perjury."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, kill me too!"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Marry, and shall."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Why should she live, to fill the world with words?"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery."
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"I'll hence to London on a serious matter:"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news."
V,V,CLARENCE,"What? what?"
V,V,GLOUCESTER,"The Tower, the Tower."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"If this foul deed were by to equal it:"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"He was a man; this, in respect, a child:"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"And men ne'er spend their fury on a child."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I will speak, that so my heart may burst."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"You have no children, butchers! if you had,"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"But if you ever chance to have a child,"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look in his youth to have him so cut off"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou."
V,V,CLARENCE,"By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it."
V,V,CLARENCE,"Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;"
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence."
V,V,QUEEN MARGARET,"So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Where's Richard gone?"
V,V,CLARENCE,"To London, all in post; and, as I guess,"
V,V,CLARENCE,"To make a bloody supper in the Tower."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"Now march we hence: discharge the common sort"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"With pay and thanks, and let's away to London"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"And see our gentle queen how well she fares:"
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"By this, I hope, she hath a son for me."
V,V,KING EDWARD IV,"3 KING HENRY VI"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And next his throat unto the butcher's knife."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"The thief doth fear each bush an officer."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"The bird that hath been limed in a bush,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Have now the fatal object in my eye"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"That taught his son the office of a fowl!"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"My breast can better brook thy dagger's point"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Than can my ears that tragic history."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Think'st thou I am an executioner?"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"If murdering innocents be executing,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Why, then thou art an executioner."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Thy son I kill'd for his presumption."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And many an orphan's water-standing eye--"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And orphans for their parents timeless death--"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And chattering pies in dismal discords sung."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"To signify thou camest to bite the world:"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"And, if the rest be true which I have heard,"
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Thou camest--"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, and for much more slaughter after this."
V,VI,KING HENRY VI,"God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"O, may such purple tears be alway shed"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"From those that wish the downfall of our house!"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"If any spark of life be yet remaining,"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"For I have often heard my mother say"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"I came into the world with my legs forward:"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"The midwife wonder'd and the women cried"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"And so I was; which plainly signified"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"That I should snarl and bite and play the dog."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"I have no brother, I am like no brother;"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Be resident in men like one another"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"And not in me: I am myself alone."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"For I will buz abroad such prophecies"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"That Edward shall be fearful of his life,"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"King Henry and the prince his son are gone:"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"Counting myself but bad till I be best."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"I'll throw thy body in another room"
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom."
V,VI,GLOUCESTER,"3 KING HENRY VI"
V,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Once more we sit in England's royal throne,"
V,VII,KING EDWARD IV,"Re-purchased with the blood of enemies."
