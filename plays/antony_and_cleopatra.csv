I,I,PHILO,"Nay, but this dotage of our general's"
I,I,PHILO,"O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,"
I,I,PHILO,"That o'er the files and musters of the war"
I,I,PHILO,"Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,"
I,I,PHILO,"The office and devotion of their view"
I,I,PHILO,"Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,"
I,I,PHILO,"Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst"
I,I,PHILO,"The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,"
I,I,PHILO,"And is become the bellows and the fan"
I,I,PHILO,"To cool a gipsy's lust."
I,I,PHILO,"Look, where they come:"
I,I,PHILO,"Take but good note, and you shall see in him."
I,I,PHILO,"The triple pillar of the world transform'd"
I,I,PHILO,"Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see."
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"If it be love indeed, tell me how much."
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd."
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved."
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth."
I,I,Attendant,"News, my good lord, from Rome."
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Grates me: the sum."
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, hear them, Antony:"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"How, my love!"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Perchance! nay, and most like:"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"You must not stay here longer, your dismission"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony."
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space."
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"On pain of punishment, the world to weet"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"We stand up peerless."
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Excellent falsehood!"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Will be himself."
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"But stirr'd by Cleopatra."
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"There's not a minute of our lives should stretch"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?"
I,I,CLEOPATRA,"Hear the ambassadors."
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Fie, wrangling queen!"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"To weep; whose every passion fully strives"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"No messenger, but thine; and all alone"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"To-night we'll wander through the streets and note"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"The qualities of people. Come, my queen;"
I,I,MARK ANTONY,"Last night you did desire it: speak not to us."
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?"
I,I,PHILO,"Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,"
I,I,PHILO,"He comes too short of that great property"
I,I,PHILO,"Which still should go with Antony."
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"I am full sorry"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"That he approves the common liar, who"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"with garlands!"
I,II,ALEXAS,"Soothsayer!"
I,II,Soothsayer,"Your will?"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?"
I,II,Soothsayer,"In nature's infinite book of secrecy"
I,II,Soothsayer,"A little I can read."
I,II,ALEXAS,"Show him your hand."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Cleopatra's health to drink."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Good sir, give me good fortune."
I,II,Soothsayer,"I make not, but foresee."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Pray, then, foresee me one."
I,II,Soothsayer,"You shall be yet far fairer than you are."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"He means in flesh."
I,II,IRAS,"No, you shall paint when you are old."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Wrinkles forbid!"
I,II,ALEXAS,"Vex not his prescience; be attentive."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Hush!"
I,II,Soothsayer,"You shall be more beloving than beloved."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"I had rather heat my liver with drinking."
I,II,ALEXAS,"Nay, hear him."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Caesar, and companion me with my mistress."
I,II,Soothsayer,"You shall outlive the lady whom you serve."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"O excellent! I love long life better than figs."
I,II,Soothsayer,"You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune"
I,II,Soothsayer,"Than that which is to approach."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Then belike my children shall have no names:"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?"
I,II,Soothsayer,"If every of your wishes had a womb."
I,II,Soothsayer,"And fertile every wish, a million."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch."
I,II,ALEXAS,"You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Nay, come, tell Iras hers."
I,II,ALEXAS,"We'll know all our fortunes."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"be--drunk to bed."
I,II,IRAS,"There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine."
I,II,IRAS,"Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"tell her but a worky-day fortune."
I,II,Soothsayer,"Your fortunes are alike."
I,II,IRAS,"But how, but how? give me particulars."
I,II,Soothsayer,"I have said."
I,II,IRAS,"Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"I, where would you choose it?"
I,II,IRAS,"Not in my husband's nose."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"follow worse, till the worst of all follow him"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!"
I,II,IRAS,"Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!"
I,II,IRAS,"for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man"
I,II,IRAS,"loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a"
I,II,IRAS,"foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep"
I,II,IRAS,"decorum, and fortune him accordingly!"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Amen."
I,II,ALEXAS,"Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a"
I,II,ALEXAS,"cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but"
I,II,ALEXAS,"they'ld do't!"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Hush! here comes Antony."
I,II,CHARMIAN,"Not he; the queen."
I,II,CLEOPATRA,"Saw you my lord?"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"No, lady."
I,II,CLEOPATRA,"Was he not here?"
I,II,CHARMIAN,"No, madam."
I,II,CLEOPATRA,"He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden"
I,II,CLEOPATRA,"A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Madam?"
I,II,CLEOPATRA,"Seek him, and bring him hither."
I,II,CLEOPATRA,"Where's Alexas?"
I,II,ALEXAS,"Here, at your service. My lord approaches."
I,II,CLEOPATRA,"We will not look upon him: go with us."
I,II,Messenger,"Fulvia thy wife first came into the field."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Against my brother Lucius?"
I,II,Messenger,"Ay:"
I,II,Messenger,"But soon that war had end, and the time's state"
I,II,Messenger,"Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;"
I,II,Messenger,"Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,"
I,II,Messenger,"Upon the first encounter, drave them."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Well, what worst?"
I,II,Messenger,"The nature of bad news infects the teller."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"When it concerns the fool or coward. On:"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"I hear him as he flatter'd."
I,II,Messenger,"Labienus--"
I,II,Messenger,"This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,"
I,II,Messenger,"Extended Asia from Euphrates;"
I,II,Messenger,"His conquering banner shook from Syria"
I,II,Messenger,"To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Antony, thou wouldst say,--"
I,II,Messenger,"O, my lord!"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"With such full licence as both truth and malice"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile."
I,II,Messenger,"At your noble pleasure."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!"
I,II,First Attendant,"The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?"
I,II,Second Attendant,"He stays upon your will."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Let him appear."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Or lose myself in dotage."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"What are you?"
I,II,Second Messenger,"Fulvia thy wife is dead."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Where died she?"
I,II,Second Messenger,"In Sicyon:"
I,II,Second Messenger,"Her length of sickness, with what else more serious"
I,II,Second Messenger,"Importeth thee to know, this bears."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Forbear me."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"What our contempt doth often hurl from us,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"By revolution lowering, does become"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"I must from this enchanting queen break off:"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"What's your pleasure, sir?"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"I must with haste from hence."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Why, then, we kill all our women:"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"if they suffer our departure, death's the word."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"I must be gone."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"them and a great cause, they should be esteemed"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"her, she hath such a celerity in dying."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"She is cunning past man's thought."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"shower of rain as well as Jove."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Would I had never seen her."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"of work; which not to have been blest withal would"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"have discredited your travel."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Fulvia is dead."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Sir?"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Fulvia is dead."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Fulvia!"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Dead."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"comforting therein, that when old robes are worn"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"out, there are members to make new. If there were"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"that should water this sorrow."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"The business she hath broached in the state"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Cannot endure my absence."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And the business you have broached here cannot be"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which"
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"wholly depends on your abode."
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"No more light answers. Let our officers"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Have notice what we purpose. I shall break"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"The cause of our expedience to the queen,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"And get her leave to part. For not alone"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Of many our contriving friends in Rome"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"The empire of the sea: our slippery people,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Whose love is never link'd to the deserver"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Till his deserts are past, begin to throw"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Pompey the Great and all his dignities"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Upon his son; who, high in name and power,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Higher than both in blood and life, stands up"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"To such whose place is under us, requires"
I,II,MARK ANTONY,"Our quick remove from hence."
I,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I shall do't."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Where is he?"
I,III,CHARMIAN,"I did not see him since."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"See where he is, who's with him, what he does:"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"I did not send you: if you find him sad,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"That I am sudden sick: quick, and return."
I,III,CHARMIAN,"Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,"
I,III,CHARMIAN,"You do not hold the method to enforce"
I,III,CHARMIAN,"The like from him."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"What should I do, I do not?"
I,III,CHARMIAN,"In each thing give him way, cross him nothing."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him."
I,III,CHARMIAN,"Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:"
I,III,CHARMIAN,"In time we hate that which we often fear."
I,III,CHARMIAN,"But here comes Antony."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"I am sick and sullen."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Will not sustain it."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Now, my dearest queen,--"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Pray you, stand further from me."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"What's the matter?"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"I know, by that same eye, there's some good news."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"What says the married woman? You may go:"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Would she had never given you leave to come!"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"I have no power upon you; hers you are."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"The gods best know,--"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"O, never was there queen"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"So mightily betray'd! yet at the first"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"I saw the treasons planted."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Cleopatra,--"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Why should I think you can be mine and true,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Which break themselves in swearing!"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Most sweet queen,--"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Then was the time for words: no going then;"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Eternity was in our lips and eyes,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"But was a race of heaven: they are so still,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Art turn'd the greatest liar."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"How now, lady!"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"There were a heart in Egypt."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Hear me, queen:"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"The strong necessity of time commands"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Our services awhile; but my full heart"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Remains in use with you. Our Italy"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Equality of two domestic powers"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Into the hearts of such as have not thrived"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"By any desperate change: my more particular,"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"And that which most with you should safe my going,"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Is Fulvia's death."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Though age from folly could not give me freedom,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"She's dead, my queen:"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"See when and where she died."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"O most false love!"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"As you shall give the advice. By the fire"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"As thou affect'st."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Cut my lace, Charmian, come;"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"So Antony loves."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"My precious queen, forbear;"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"And give true evidence to his love, which stands"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"An honourable trial."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"So Fulvia told me."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Of excellent dissembling; and let it look"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Life perfect honour."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"You'll heat my blood: no more."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"You can do better yet; but this is meetly."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Now, by my sword,--"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"And target. Still he mends;"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"How this Herculean Roman does become"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"The carriage of his chafe."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"I'll leave you, lady."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Courteous lord, one word."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"That you know well: something it is I would,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"O, my oblivion is a very Antony,"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"And I am all forgotten."
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"But that your royalty"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Holds idleness your subject, I should take you"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"For idleness itself."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"'Tis sweating labour"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"To bear such idleness so near the heart"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Since my becomings kill me, when they do not"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly."
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"And all the gods go with you! upon your sword"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Sit laurel victory! and smooth success"
I,III,CLEOPATRA,"Be strew'd before your feet!"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Let us go. Come;"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"Our separation so abides, and flies,"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,"
I,III,MARK ANTONY,"And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our great competitor: from Alexandria"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A man who is the abstract of all faults"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That all men follow."
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"I must not think there are"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"Evils enow to darken all his goodness:"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"Than what he chooses."
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"With knaves that smell of sweat: say this"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"becomes him,--"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As his composure must be rare indeed"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"No way excuse his soils, when we do bear"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"His vacancy with his voluptuousness,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Call on him for't: but to confound such time,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And so rebel to judgment."
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"Here's more news."
I,IV,Messenger,"Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,"
I,IV,Messenger,"Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report"
I,IV,Messenger,"How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;"
I,IV,Messenger,"And it appears he is beloved of those"
I,IV,Messenger,"That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports"
I,IV,Messenger,"The discontents repair, and men's reports"
I,IV,Messenger,"Give him much wrong'd."
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I should have known no less."
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It hath been taught us from the primal state,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That he which is was wish'd until he were;"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To rot itself with motion."
I,IV,Messenger,"Caesar, I bring thee word,"
I,IV,Messenger,"Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,"
I,IV,Messenger,"Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound"
I,IV,Messenger,"With keels of every kind: many hot inroads"
I,IV,Messenger,"They make in Italy; the borders maritime"
I,IV,Messenger,"Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:"
I,IV,Messenger,"No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon"
I,IV,Messenger,"Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more"
I,IV,Messenger,"Than could his war resisted."
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Antony,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Though daintily brought up, with patience more"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which some did die to look on: and all this--"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"So much as lank'd not."
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"'Tis pity of him."
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Let his shames quickly"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Assemble we immediate council: Pompey"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Thrives in our idleness."
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"To-morrow, Caesar,"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"Both what by sea and land I can be able"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"To front this present time."
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Till which encounter,"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It is my business too. Farewell."
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,"
I,IV,LEPIDUS,"To let me be partaker."
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Doubt not, sir;"
I,IV,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I knew it for my bond."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Charmian!"
I,V,CHARMIAN,"Madam?"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Ha, ha!"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Give me to drink mandragora."
I,V,CHARMIAN,"Why, madam?"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"That I might sleep out this great gap of time"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"My Antony is away."
I,V,CHARMIAN,"You think of him too much."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"O, 'tis treason!"
I,V,CHARMIAN,"Madam, I trust, not so."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Thou, eunuch Mardian!"
I,V,MARDIAN,"What's your highness' pleasure?"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?"
I,V,MARDIAN,"Yes, gracious madam."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Indeed!"
I,V,MARDIAN,"Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing"
I,V,MARDIAN,"But what indeed is honest to be done:"
I,V,MARDIAN,"Yet have I fierce affections, and think"
I,V,MARDIAN,"What Venus did with Mars."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"O Charmian,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"For so he calls me: now I feed myself"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"With most delicious poison. Think on me,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"When thou wast here above the ground, I was"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"There would he anchor his aspect and die"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"With looking on his life."
I,V,ALEXAS,"Sovereign of Egypt, hail!"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"With his tinct gilded thee."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Last thing he did, dear queen,"
I,V,ALEXAS,"He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--"
I,V,ALEXAS,"This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Mine ear must pluck it thence."
I,V,ALEXAS,"'Good friend,' quoth he,"
I,V,ALEXAS,"'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends"
I,V,ALEXAS,"This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,"
I,V,ALEXAS,"To mend the petty present, I will piece"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,"
I,V,ALEXAS,"And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Was beastly dumb'd by him."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"What, was he sad or merry?"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Like to the time o' the year between the extremes"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"O well-divided disposition! Note him,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"He was not sad, for he would shine on those"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"That make their looks by his; he was not merry,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"In Egypt with his joy; but between both:"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"The violence of either thee becomes,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:"
I,V,ALEXAS,"Why do you send so thick?"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Who's born that day"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"When I forget to send to Antony,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Ever love Caesar so?"
I,V,CHARMIAN,"O that brave Caesar!"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Be choked with such another emphasis!"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Say, the brave Antony."
I,V,CHARMIAN,"The valiant Caesar!"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"If thou with Caesar paragon again"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"My man of men."
I,V,CHARMIAN,"By your most gracious pardon,"
I,V,CHARMIAN,"I sing but after you."
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"My salad days,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"To say as I said then! But, come, away;"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Get me ink and paper:"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"He shall have every day a several greeting,"
I,V,CLEOPATRA,"Or I'll unpeople Egypt."
II,I,POMPEY,"If the great gods be just, they shall assist"
II,I,POMPEY,"The deeds of justest men."
II,I,MENECRATES,"Know, worthy Pompey,"
II,I,MENECRATES,"That what they do delay, they not deny."
II,I,POMPEY,"Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays"
II,I,POMPEY,"The thing we sue for."
II,I,MENECRATES,"We, ignorant of ourselves,"
II,I,MENECRATES,"Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers"
II,I,MENECRATES,"Deny us for our good; so find we profit"
II,I,MENECRATES,"By losing of our prayers."
II,I,POMPEY,"I shall do well:"
II,I,POMPEY,"The people love me, and the sea is mine;"
II,I,POMPEY,"My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope"
II,I,POMPEY,"Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony"
II,I,POMPEY,"In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make"
II,I,POMPEY,"No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where"
II,I,POMPEY,"He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,"
II,I,POMPEY,"Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,"
II,I,POMPEY,"Nor either cares for him."
II,I,MENAS,"Caesar and Lepidus"
II,I,MENAS,"Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry."
II,I,POMPEY,"Where have you this? 'tis false."
II,I,MENAS,"From Silvius, sir."
II,I,POMPEY,"He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,"
II,I,POMPEY,"Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,"
II,I,POMPEY,"Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!"
II,I,POMPEY,"Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!"
II,I,POMPEY,"Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,"
II,I,POMPEY,"Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks"
II,I,POMPEY,"Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;"
II,I,POMPEY,"That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour"
II,I,POMPEY,"Even till a Lethe'd dulness!"
II,I,POMPEY,"How now, Varrius!"
II,I,VARRIUS,"This is most certain that I shall deliver:"
II,I,VARRIUS,"Mark Antony is every hour in Rome"
II,I,VARRIUS,"Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis"
II,I,VARRIUS,"A space for further travel."
II,I,POMPEY,"I could have given less matter"
II,I,POMPEY,"A better ear. Menas, I did not think"
II,I,POMPEY,"This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm"
II,I,POMPEY,"For such a petty war: his soldiership"
II,I,POMPEY,"Is twice the other twain: but let us rear"
II,I,POMPEY,"The higher our opinion, that our stirring"
II,I,POMPEY,"Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck"
II,I,POMPEY,"The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony."
II,I,MENAS,"I cannot hope"
II,I,MENAS,"Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:"
II,I,MENAS,"His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;"
II,I,MENAS,"His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,"
II,I,MENAS,"Not moved by Antony."
II,I,POMPEY,"I know not, Menas,"
II,I,POMPEY,"How lesser enmities may give way to greater."
II,I,POMPEY,"Were't not that we stand up against them all,"
II,I,POMPEY,"'Twere pregnant they should square between"
II,I,POMPEY,"themselves;"
II,I,POMPEY,"For they have entertained cause enough"
II,I,POMPEY,"To draw their swords: but how the fear of us"
II,I,POMPEY,"May cement their divisions and bind up"
II,I,POMPEY,"The petty difference, we yet not know."
II,I,POMPEY,"Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands"
II,I,POMPEY,"Our lives upon to use our strongest hands."
II,I,POMPEY,"Come, Menas."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"And shall become you well, to entreat your captain"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"To soft and gentle speech."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I shall entreat him"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Let Antony look over Caesar's head"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I would not shave't to-day."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"'Tis not a time"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"For private stomaching."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Every time"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Serves for the matter that is then born in't."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"But small to greater matters must give way."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Not if the small come first."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Your speech is passion:"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"The noble Antony."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And yonder, Caesar."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"If we compose well here, to Parthia:"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Hark, Ventidius."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I do not know,"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Mecaenas; ask Agrippa."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Noble friends,"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"That which combined us was most great, and let not"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"May it be gently heard: when we debate"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Our trivial difference loud, we do commit"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"The rather, for I earnestly beseech,"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Nor curstness grow to the matter."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"'Tis spoken well."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Were we before our armies, and to fight."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"I should do thus."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Welcome to Rome."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Thank you."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Sit."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Sit, sir."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Nay, then."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"I learn, you take things ill which are not so,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Or being, concern you not."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I must be laugh'd at,"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If, or for nothing or a little, I"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should say myself offended, and with you"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Once name you derogately, when to sound your name"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It not concern'd me."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"My being in Egypt, Caesar,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"What was't to you?"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"No more than my residing here at Rome"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Might be my question."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"How intend you, practised?"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You may be pleased to catch at mine intent"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Made wars upon me; and their contestation"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Was theme for you, you were the word of war."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"You do mistake your business; my brother never"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"And have my learning from some true reports,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Discredit my authority with yours;"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"And make the wars alike against my stomach,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Having alike your cause? Of this my letters"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"As matter whole you have not to make it with,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"It must not be with this."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You praise yourself"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"By laying defects of judgment to me; but"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You patch'd up your excuses."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Not so, not so;"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Very necessity of this thought, that I,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"I would you had her spirit in such another:"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"You may pace easy, but not such a wife."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Would we had all such wives, that the men might go"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"to wars with the women!"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Made out of her impatience, which not wanted"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Did you too much disquiet: for that you must"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"But say, I could not help it."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I wrote to you"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"When rioting in Alexandria; you"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did gibe my missive out of audience."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Sir,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"He fell upon me ere admitted: then"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Of what I was i' the morning: but next day"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"I told him of myself; which was as much"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Out of our question wipe him."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You have broken"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The article of your oath; which you shall never"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Have tongue to charge me with."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Soft, Caesar!"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"No,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Lepidus, let him speak:"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"The honour is sacred which he talks on now,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"The article of my oath."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To lend me arms and aid when I required them;"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The which you both denied."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Neglected, rather;"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"And then when poison'd hours had bound me up"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"For which myself, the ignorant motive, do"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"So far ask pardon as befits mine honour"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"To stoop in such a case."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"'Tis noble spoken."
II,II,MECAENAS,"If it might please you, to enforce no further"
II,II,MECAENAS,"The griefs between ye: to forget them quite"
II,II,MECAENAS,"Were to remember that the present need"
II,II,MECAENAS,"Speaks to atone you."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Worthily spoken, Mecaenas."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Or, if you borrow one another's love for the"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"instant, you may, when you hear no more words of"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"wrangle in when you have nothing else to do."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Thou art a soldier only: speak no more."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That truth should be silent I had almost forgot."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Go to, then; your considerate stone."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I do not much dislike the matter, but"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The manner of his speech; for't cannot be"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"We shall remain in friendship, our conditions"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"O' the world I would pursue it."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Give me leave, Caesar,--"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Speak, Agrippa."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Is now a widower."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Say not so, Agrippa:"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Were well deserved of rashness."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"I am not married, Caesar: let me hear"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Agrippa further speak."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"To hold you in perpetual amity,"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"With an unslipping knot, take Antony"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"No worse a husband than the best of men;"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Whose virtue and whose general graces speak"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"That which none else can utter. By this marriage,"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"All little jealousies, which now seem great,"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"And all great fears, which now import their dangers,"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Where now half tales be truths: her love to both"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Would, each to other and all loves to both,"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"By duty ruminated."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Will Caesar speak?"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"With what is spoke already."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"What power is in Agrippa,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"To make this good?"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The power of Caesar, and"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"His power unto Octavia."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"May I never"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Further this act of grace: and from this hour"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"The heart of brothers govern in our loves"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"And sway our great designs!"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"There is my hand."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did ever love so dearly: let her live"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Fly off our loves again!"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Happily, amen!"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"For he hath laid strange courtesies and great"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Of late upon me: I must thank him only,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"At heel of that, defy him."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Time calls upon's:"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Of us must Pompey presently be sought,"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Or else he seeks out us."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Where lies he?"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"About the mount Misenum."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"What is his strength by land?"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Great and increasing: but by sea"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"He is an absolute master."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"So is the fame."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"The business we have talk'd of."
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"With most gladness:"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And do invite you to my sister's view,"
II,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Whither straight I'll lead you."
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Let us, Lepidus,"
II,II,MARK ANTONY,"Not lack your company."
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Noble Antony,"
II,II,LEPIDUS,"Not sickness should detain me."
II,II,MECAENAS,"Welcome from Egypt, sir."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"honourable friend, Agrippa!"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Good Enobarbus!"
II,II,MECAENAS,"We have cause to be glad that matters are so well"
II,II,MECAENAS,"digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"made the night light with drinking."
II,II,MECAENAS,"Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and"
II,II,MECAENAS,"but twelve persons there; is this true?"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting."
II,II,MECAENAS,"She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to"
II,II,MECAENAS,"her."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"his heart, upon the river of Cydnus."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"well for her."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I will tell you."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Purple the sails, and so perfumed that"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The water which they beat to follow faster,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"It beggar'd all description: she did lie"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"O'er-picturing that Venus where we see"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The fancy outwork nature: on each side her"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And what they undid did."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"O, rare for Antony!"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And made their bends adornings: at the helm"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That yarely frame the office. From the barge"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A strange invisible perfume hits the sense"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Her people out upon her; and Antony,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And made a gap in nature."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Rare Egyptian!"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Invited her to supper: she replied,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"It should be better he became her guest;"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And for his ordinary pays his heart"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"For what his eyes eat only."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Royal wench!"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"He plough'd her, and she cropp'd."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I saw her once"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Hop forty paces through the public street;"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That she did make defect perfection,"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And, breathless, power breathe forth."
II,II,MECAENAS,"Now Antony must leave her utterly."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Never; he will not:"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Her infinite variety: other women cloy"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Where most she satisfies; for vilest things"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Become themselves in her: that the holy priests"
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Bless her when she is riggish."
II,II,MECAENAS,"If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle"
II,II,MECAENAS,"The heart of Antony, Octavia is"
II,II,MECAENAS,"A blessed lottery to him."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Let us go."
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest"
II,II,AGRIPPA,"Whilst you abide here."
II,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Humbly, sir, I thank you."
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"The world and my great office will sometimes"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Divide me from your bosom."
II,III,OCTAVIA,"All which time"
II,III,OCTAVIA,"Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers"
II,III,OCTAVIA,"To them for you."
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Good night, sir. My Octavia,"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Read not my blemishes in the world's report:"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"I have not kept my square; but that to come"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady."
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Good night, sir."
II,III,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Good night."
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"If you can, your reason?"
II,III,Soothsayer,"I see it in"
II,III,Soothsayer,"My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Hie you to Egypt again."
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Say to me,"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Caesar's."
II,III,Soothsayer,"Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Make space enough between you."
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Speak this no more."
II,III,Soothsayer,"To none but thee; no more, but when to thee."
II,III,Soothsayer,"If thou dost play with him at any game,"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,"
II,III,Soothsayer,"He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,"
II,III,Soothsayer,"When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit"
II,III,Soothsayer,"Is all afraid to govern thee near him;"
II,III,Soothsayer,"But, he away, 'tis noble."
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Get thee gone:"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"And in our sports my better cunning faints"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"His cocks do win the battle still of mine,"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"When it is all to nought; and his quails ever"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"And though I make this marriage for my peace,"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"I' the east my pleasure lies."
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"O, come, Ventidius,"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;"
II,III,MARK ANTONY,"Follow me, and receive't."
II,IV,LEPIDUS,"Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten"
II,IV,LEPIDUS,"Your generals after."
II,IV,AGRIPPA,"Sir, Mark Antony"
II,IV,AGRIPPA,"Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow."
II,IV,LEPIDUS,"Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,"
II,IV,LEPIDUS,"Which will become you both, farewell."
II,IV,MECAENAS,"We shall,"
II,IV,MECAENAS,"As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount"
II,IV,MECAENAS,"Before you, Lepidus."
II,IV,LEPIDUS,"Your way is shorter;"
II,IV,LEPIDUS,"My purposes do draw me much about:"
II,IV,LEPIDUS,"You'll win two days upon me."
II,IV,MECAENAS,"Sir, good success!"
II,IV,LEPIDUS,"Farewell."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Give me some music; music, moody food"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Of us that trade in love."
II,V,Attendants,"The music, ho!"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian."
II,V,CHARMIAN,"My arm is sore; best play with Mardian."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"As well a woman with an eunuch play'd"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?"
II,V,MARDIAN,"As well as I can, madam."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"And when good will is show'd, though't come"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"too short,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"My music playing far off, I will betray"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I'll think them every one an Antony,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'"
II,V,CHARMIAN,"'Twas merry when"
II,V,CHARMIAN,"You wager'd on your angling; when your diver"
II,V,CHARMIAN,"Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he"
II,V,CHARMIAN,"With fervency drew up."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"That time,--O times!--"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I wore his sword Philippan."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"O, from Italy"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"That long time have been barren."
II,V,Messenger,"Madam, madam,--"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing."
II,V,Messenger,"First, madam, he is well."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Why, there's more gold."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"But, sirrah, mark, we use"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"To say the dead are well: bring it to that,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The gold I give thee will I melt and pour"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Down thy ill-uttering throat."
II,V,Messenger,"Good madam, hear me."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Well, go to, I will;"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Not like a formal man."
II,V,Messenger,"Will't please you hear me?"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Rich pearls upon thee."
II,V,Messenger,"Madam, he's well."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Well said."
II,V,Messenger,"And friends with Caesar."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Thou'rt an honest man."
II,V,Messenger,"Caesar and he are greater friends than ever."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Make thee a fortune from me."
II,V,Messenger,"But yet, madam,--"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free."
II,V,Messenger,"Free, madam! no; I made no such report:"
II,V,Messenger,"He's bound unto Octavia."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"For what good turn?"
II,V,Messenger,"For the best turn i' the bed."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I am pale, Charmian."
II,V,Messenger,"Madam, he's married to Octavia."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The most infectious pestilence upon thee!"
II,V,Messenger,"Good madam, patience."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"What say you? Hence,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Smarting in lingering pickle."
II,V,Messenger,"Gracious madam,"
II,V,Messenger,"I that do bring the news made not the match."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"And I will boot thee with what gift beside"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Thy modesty can beg."
II,V,Messenger,"He's married, madam."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Rogue, thou hast lived too long."
II,V,Messenger,"Nay, then I'll run."
II,V,Messenger,"What mean you, madam? I have made no fault."
II,V,CHARMIAN,"Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:"
II,V,CHARMIAN,"The man is innocent."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call."
II,V,CHARMIAN,"He is afeard to come."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I will not hurt him."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"These hands do lack nobility, that they strike"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"A meaner than myself; since I myself"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Have given myself the cause."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Come hither, sir."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Though it be honest, it is never good"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"To bring bad news: give to a gracious message."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Themselves when they be felt."
II,V,Messenger,"I have done my duty."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Is he married?"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I cannot hate thee worser than I do,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"If thou again say 'Yes.'"
II,V,Messenger,"He's married, madam."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?"
II,V,Messenger,"Should I lie, madam?"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"O, I would thou didst,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"So half my Egypt were submerged and made"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?"
II,V,Messenger,"I crave your highness' pardon."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"He is married?"
II,V,Messenger,"Take no offence that I would not offend you:"
II,V,Messenger,"To punish me for what you make me do."
II,V,Messenger,"Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"And be undone by 'em!"
II,V,CHARMIAN,"Good your highness, patience."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar."
II,V,CHARMIAN,"Many times, madam."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I am paid for't now."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Lead me from hence:"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Report the feature of Octavia, her years,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Her inclination, let him not leave out"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly."
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,"
II,V,CLEOPATRA,"But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Your hostages I have, so have you mine;"
II,VI,POMPEY,"And we shall talk before we fight."
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Most meet"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That first we come to words; and therefore have we"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our written purposes before us sent;"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And carry back to Sicily much tall youth"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That else must perish here."
II,VI,POMPEY,"To you all three,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"The senators alone of this great world,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Chief factors for the gods, I do not know"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Wherefore my father should revengers want,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"There saw you labouring for him. What was't"
II,VI,POMPEY,"That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"To drench the Capitol; but that they would"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Have one man but a man? And that is it"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen"
II,VI,POMPEY,"The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant"
II,VI,POMPEY,"To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Cast on my noble father."
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Take your time."
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;"
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st"
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"How much we do o'er-count thee."
II,VI,POMPEY,"At land, indeed,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:"
II,VI,POMPEY,"But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Remain in't as thou mayst."
II,VI,LEPIDUS,"Be pleased to tell us--"
II,VI,LEPIDUS,"For this is from the present--how you take"
II,VI,LEPIDUS,"The offers we have sent you."
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"There's the point."
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"Which do not be entreated to, but weigh"
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"What it is worth embraced."
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And what may follow,"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To try a larger fortune."
II,VI,POMPEY,"You have made me offer"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon"
II,VI,POMPEY,"To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Our targes undinted."
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That's our offer."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Know, then,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"I came before you here a man prepared"
II,VI,POMPEY,"To take this offer: but Mark Antony"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Put me to some impatience: though I lose"
II,VI,POMPEY,"The praise of it by telling, you must know,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"When Caesar and your brother were at blows,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Your mother came to Sicily and did find"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Her welcome friendly."
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"I have heard it, Pompey;"
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"And am well studied for a liberal thanks"
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"Which I do owe you."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Let me have your hand:"
II,VI,POMPEY,"I did not think, sir, to have met you here."
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,"
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;"
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"For I have gain'd by 't."
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Since I saw you last,"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"There is a change upon you."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Well, I know not"
II,VI,POMPEY,"What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;"
II,VI,POMPEY,"But in my bosom shall she never come,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"To make my heart her vassal."
II,VI,LEPIDUS,"Well met here."
II,VI,POMPEY,"I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:"
II,VI,POMPEY,"I crave our composition may be written,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"And seal'd between us."
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That's the next to do."
II,VI,POMPEY,"We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Draw lots who shall begin."
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"That will I, Pompey."
II,VI,POMPEY,"No, Antony, take the lot: but, first"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Grew fat with feasting there."
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"You have heard much."
II,VI,POMPEY,"I have fair meanings, sir."
II,VI,MARK ANTONY,"And fair words to them."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Then so much have I heard:"
II,VI,POMPEY,"And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"No more of that: he did so."
II,VI,POMPEY,"What, I pray you?"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress."
II,VI,POMPEY,"I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Well;"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And well am like to do; for, I perceive,"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Four feasts are toward."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Let me shake thy hand;"
II,VI,POMPEY,"I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"When I have envied thy behavior."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Sir,"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"When you have well deserved ten times as much"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"As I have said you did."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Enjoy thy plainness,"
II,VI,POMPEY,"It nothing ill becomes thee."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Aboard my galley I invite you all:"
II,VI,POMPEY,"Will you lead, lords?"
II,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Show us the way, sir."
II,VI,POMPEY,"Come."
II,VI,MENAS,"made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"At sea, I think."
II,VI,MENAS,"We have, sir."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"You have done well by water."
II,VI,MENAS,"And you by land."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I will praise any man that will praise me; though it"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"cannot be denied what I have done by land."
II,VI,MENAS,"Nor what I have done by water."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Yes, something you can deny for your own"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"safety: you have been a great thief by sea."
II,VI,MENAS,"And you by land."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"There I deny my land service. But give me your"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"might take two thieves kissing."
II,VI,MENAS,"All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"But there is never a fair woman has a true face."
II,VI,MENAS,"No slander; they steal hearts."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"We came hither to fight with you."
II,VI,MENAS,"For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking."
II,VI,MENAS,"Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again."
II,VI,MENAS,"You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony"
II,VI,MENAS,"here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Caesar's sister is called Octavia."
II,VI,MENAS,"True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius."
II,VI,MENAS,"Pray ye, sir?"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"'Tis true."
II,VI,MENAS,"Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"not prophesy so."
II,VI,MENAS,"I think the policy of that purpose made more in the"
II,VI,MENAS,"marriage than the love of the parties."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I think so too. But you shall find, the band that"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"seems to tie their friendship together will be the"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"holy, cold, and still conversation."
II,VI,MENAS,"Who would not have his wife so?"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I said before, that which is the strength of their"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"amity shall prove the immediate author of their"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:"
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"he married but his occasion here."
II,VI,MENAS,"And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?"
II,VI,MENAS,"I have a health for you."
II,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt."
II,VI,MENAS,"Come, let's away."
II,VII,First Servant,"Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are"
II,VII,First Servant,"ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world"
II,VII,First Servant,"will blow them down."
II,VII,Second Servant,"Lepidus is high-coloured."
II,VII,First Servant,"They have made him drink alms-drink."
II,VII,Second Servant,"As they pinch one another by the disposition, he"
II,VII,Second Servant,"cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his"
II,VII,Second Servant,"entreaty, and himself to the drink."
II,VII,First Servant,"But it raises the greater war between him and"
II,VII,First Servant,"his discretion."
II,VII,Second Servant,"Why, this is to have a name in great men's"
II,VII,Second Servant,"fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do"
II,VII,Second Servant,"me no service as a partisan I could not heave."
II,VII,First Servant,"To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen"
II,VII,First Servant,"to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,"
II,VII,First Servant,"which pitifully disaster the cheeks."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"the flow o' the Nile"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"And shortly comes to harvest."
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"You've strange serpents there."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Ay, Lepidus."
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the"
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"operation of your sun: so is your crocodile."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"They are so."
II,VII,POMPEY,"Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!"
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then."
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'"
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"pyramises are very goodly things; without"
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"contradiction, I have heard that."
II,VII,POMPEY,"what is't?"
II,VII,MENAS,"thee, captain,"
II,VII,MENAS,"And hear me speak a word."
II,VII,POMPEY,"This wine for Lepidus!"
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"What manner o' thing is your crocodile?"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"and moves with its own organs: it lives by that"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"it, it transmigrates."
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"What colour is it of?"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Of it own colour too."
II,VII,LEPIDUS,"'Tis a strange serpent."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet."
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Will this description satisfy him?"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"very epicure."
II,VII,POMPEY,"that? away!"
II,VII,POMPEY,"Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?"
II,VII,MENAS,"wilt hear me,"
II,VII,MENAS,"Rise from thy stool."
II,VII,POMPEY,"The matter?"
II,VII,MENAS,"I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes."
II,VII,POMPEY,"Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?"
II,VII,POMPEY,"Be jolly, lords."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"These quick-sands, Lepidus,"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Keep off them, for you sink."
II,VII,MENAS,"Wilt thou be lord of all the world?"
II,VII,POMPEY,"What say'st thou?"
II,VII,MENAS,"Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice."
II,VII,POMPEY,"How should that be?"
II,VII,MENAS,"But entertain it,"
II,VII,MENAS,"And, though thou think me poor, I am the man"
II,VII,MENAS,"Will give thee all the world."
II,VII,POMPEY,"Hast thou drunk well?"
II,VII,MENAS,"Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup."
II,VII,MENAS,"Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:"
II,VII,MENAS,"Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,"
II,VII,MENAS,"Is thine, if thou wilt ha't."
II,VII,POMPEY,"Show me which way."
II,VII,MENAS,"These three world-sharers, these competitors,"
II,VII,MENAS,"Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;"
II,VII,MENAS,"And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:"
II,VII,MENAS,"All there is thine."
II,VII,POMPEY,"Ah, this thou shouldst have done,"
II,VII,POMPEY,"And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;"
II,VII,POMPEY,"In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,"
II,VII,POMPEY,"'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;"
II,VII,POMPEY,"Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue"
II,VII,POMPEY,"Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,"
II,VII,POMPEY,"I should have found it afterwards well done;"
II,VII,POMPEY,"But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink."
II,VII,MENAS,"I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more."
II,VII,MENAS,"Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,"
II,VII,MENAS,"Shall never find it more."
II,VII,POMPEY,"This health to Lepidus!"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Here's to thee, Menas!"
II,VII,MENAS,"Enobarbus, welcome!"
II,VII,POMPEY,"Fill till the cup be hid."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"There's a strong fellow, Menas."
II,VII,MENAS,"Why?"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"not?"
II,VII,MENAS,"The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,"
II,VII,MENAS,"That it might go on wheels!"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Drink thou; increase the reels."
II,VII,MENAS,"Come."
II,VII,POMPEY,"This is not yet an Alexandrian feast."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Here is to Caesar!"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I could well forbear't."
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And it grows fouler."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Be a child o' the time."
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Possess it, I'll make answer:"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"But I had rather fast from all four days"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Than drink so much in one."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ha, my brave emperor!"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And celebrate our drink?"
II,VII,POMPEY,"Let's ha't, good soldier."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Come, let's all take hands,"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense"
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"In soft and delicate Lethe."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"All take hands."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Make battery to our ears with the loud music:"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The holding every man shall bear as loud"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"As his strong sides can volley."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Come, thou monarch of the vine,"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"In thy fats our cares be drown'd,"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Cup us, till the world go round,"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Cup us, till the world go round!"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Let me request you off: our graver business"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost"
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night."
II,VII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Good Antony, your hand."
II,VII,POMPEY,"I'll try you on the shore."
II,VII,MARK ANTONY,"And shall, sir; give's your hand."
II,VII,POMPEY,"O Antony,"
II,VII,POMPEY,"You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends."
II,VII,POMPEY,"Come, down into the boat."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Take heed you fall not."
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Menas, I'll not on shore."
II,VII,MENAS,"No, to my cabin."
II,VII,MENAS,"These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!"
II,VII,MENAS,"Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell"
II,VII,MENAS,"To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!"
II,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ho! says a' There's my cap."
II,VII,MENAS,"Ho! Noble captain, come."
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Pays this for Marcus Crassus."
III,I,SILIUS,"Noble Ventidius,"
III,I,SILIUS,"Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,"
III,I,SILIUS,"The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,"
III,I,SILIUS,"Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither"
III,I,SILIUS,"The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony"
III,I,SILIUS,"Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and"
III,I,SILIUS,"Put garlands on thy head."
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"O Silius, Silius,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"I have done enough; a lower place, note well,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Better to leave undone, than by our deed"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away."
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Caesar and Antony have ever won"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"More in their officer than person: Sossius,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"For quick accumulation of renown,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour."
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Who does i' the wars more than his captain can"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Than gain which darkens him."
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"I could do more to do Antonius good,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"But 'twould offend him; and in his offence"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"Should my performance perish."
III,I,SILIUS,"Thou hast, Ventidius,"
III,I,SILIUS,"that"
III,I,SILIUS,"Without the which a soldier, and his sword,"
III,I,SILIUS,"Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"I'll humbly signify what in his name,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"That magical word of war, we have effected;"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"We have jaded out o' the field."
III,I,SILIUS,"Where is he now?"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"The weight we must convey with's will permit,"
III,I,VENTIDIUS,"We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!"
III,II,AGRIPPA,"What, are the brothers parted?"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"With the green sickness."
III,II,AGRIPPA,"'Tis a noble Lepidus."
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!"
III,II,AGRIPPA,"Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men."
III,II,AGRIPPA,"What's Antony? The god of Jupiter."
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!"
III,II,AGRIPPA,"O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further."
III,II,AGRIPPA,"Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises."
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"poets, cannot"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder."
III,II,AGRIPPA,"Both he loves."
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"They are his shards, and he their beetle."
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"So;"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa."
III,II,AGRIPPA,"Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell."
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"No further, sir."
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You take from me a great part of myself;"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Let not the piece of virtue, which is set"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Betwixt us as the cement of our love,"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To keep it builded, be the ram to batter"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The fortress of it; for better might we"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Have loved without this mean, if on both parts"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"This be not cherish'd."
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"Make me not offended"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"In your distrust."
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have said."
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"You shall not find,"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"Though you be therein curious, the least cause"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"We will here part."
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The elements be kind to thee, and make"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well."
III,II,OCTAVIA,"My noble brother!"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful."
III,II,OCTAVIA,"Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What, Octavia?"
III,II,OCTAVIA,"I'll tell you in your ear."
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"down-feather,"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"That stands upon the swell at full of tide,"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"And neither way inclines."
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"were he a horse;"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"So is he, being a man."
III,II,AGRIPPA,"When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,"
III,II,AGRIPPA,"He cried almost to roaring; and he wept"
III,II,AGRIPPA,"When at Philippi he found Brutus slain."
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"troubled with a rheum;"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"What willingly he did confound he wail'd,"
III,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Believe't, till I wept too."
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"No, sweet Octavia,"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You shall hear from me still; the time shall not"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Out-go my thinking on you."
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"Come, sir, come;"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"And give you to the gods."
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Adieu; be happy!"
III,II,LEPIDUS,"Let all the number of the stars give light"
III,II,LEPIDUS,"To thy fair way!"
III,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Farewell, farewell!"
III,II,MARK ANTONY,"Farewell!"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Where is the fellow?"
III,III,ALEXAS,"Half afeard to come."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Go to, go to."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Come hither, sir."
III,III,ALEXAS,"Good majesty,"
III,III,ALEXAS,"Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you"
III,III,ALEXAS,"But when you are well pleased."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"That Herod's head"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Through whom I might command it? Come thou near."
III,III,Messenger,"Most gracious majesty,--"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Didst thou behold Octavia?"
III,III,Messenger,"Ay, dread queen."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Where?"
III,III,Messenger,"Madam, in Rome;"
III,III,Messenger,"I look'd her in the face, and saw her led"
III,III,Messenger,"Between her brother and Mark Antony."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Is she as tall as me?"
III,III,Messenger,"She is not, madam."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?"
III,III,Messenger,"Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"That's not so good: he cannot like her long."
III,III,CHARMIAN,"Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"What majesty is in her gait? Remember,"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"If e'er thou look'dst on majesty."
III,III,Messenger,"She creeps:"
III,III,Messenger,"Her motion and her station are as one;"
III,III,Messenger,"She shows a body rather than a life,"
III,III,Messenger,"A statue than a breather."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Is this certain?"
III,III,Messenger,"Or I have no observance."
III,III,CHARMIAN,"Three in Egypt"
III,III,CHARMIAN,"Cannot make better note."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"He's very knowing;"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"The fellow has good judgment."
III,III,CHARMIAN,"Excellent."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Guess at her years, I prithee."
III,III,Messenger,"Madam,"
III,III,Messenger,"She was a widow,--"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Widow! Charmian, hark."
III,III,Messenger,"And I do think she's thirty."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?"
III,III,Messenger,"Round even to faultiness."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Her hair, what colour?"
III,III,Messenger,"Brown, madam: and her forehead"
III,III,Messenger,"As low as she would wish it."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"There's gold for thee."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"I will employ thee back again; I find thee"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Most fit for business: go make thee ready;"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Our letters are prepared."
III,III,CHARMIAN,"A proper man."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Indeed, he is so: I repent me much"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"This creature's no such thing."
III,III,CHARMIAN,"Nothing, madam."
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"The man hath seen some majesty, and should know."
III,III,CHARMIAN,"Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,"
III,III,CHARMIAN,"And serving you so long!"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me"
III,III,CLEOPATRA,"Where I will write. All may be well enough."
III,III,CHARMIAN,"I warrant you, madam."
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"That were excusable, that, and thousands more"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Of semblable import,--but he hath waged"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"To public ear:"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"When the best hint was given him, he not took't,"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Or did it from his teeth."
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"O my good lord,"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"Believe not all; or, if you must believe,"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"If this division chance, ne'er stood between,"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"Praying for both parts:"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"The good gods me presently,"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"'Twixt these extremes at all."
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Gentle Octavia,"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"I lose myself: better I were not yours"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"I'll raise the preparation of a war"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"So your desires are yours."
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"Thanks to my lord."
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"As if the world should cleave, and that slain men"
III,IV,OCTAVIA,"Should solder up the rift."
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"When it appears to you where this begins,"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Can never be so equal, that your love"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Can equally move with them. Provide your going;"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Choose your own company, and command what cost"
III,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Your heart has mind to."
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"How now, friend Eros!"
III,V,EROS,"There's strange news come, sir."
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"What, man?"
III,V,EROS,"Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey."
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"This is old: what is the success?"
III,V,EROS,"Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst"
III,V,EROS,"Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let"
III,V,EROS,"him partake in the glory of the action: and not"
III,V,EROS,"resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly"
III,V,EROS,"wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so"
III,V,EROS,"the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine."
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;"
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And throw between them all the food thou hast,"
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?"
III,V,EROS,"He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns"
III,V,EROS,"The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'"
III,V,EROS,"And threats the throat of that his officer"
III,V,EROS,"That murder'd Pompey."
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Our great navy's rigg'd."
III,V,EROS,"For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;"
III,V,EROS,"My lord desires you presently: my news"
III,V,EROS,"I might have told hereafter."
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"'Twill be naught:"
III,V,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"But let it be. Bring me to Antony."
III,V,EROS,"Come, sir."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And all the unlawful issue that their lust"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Since then hath made between them. Unto her"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Absolute queen."
III,VI,MECAENAS,"This in the public eye?"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I' the common show-place, where they exercise."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In the habiliments of the goddess Isis"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As 'tis reported, so."
III,VI,MECAENAS,"Let Rome be thus Inform'd."
III,VI,AGRIPPA,"Who, queasy with his insolence"
III,VI,AGRIPPA,"Already, will their good thoughts call from him."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The people know it; and have now received"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"His accusations."
III,VI,AGRIPPA,"Who does he accuse?"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Caesar: and that, having in Sicily"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That Lepidus of the triumvirate"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"All his revenue."
III,VI,AGRIPPA,"Sir, this should be answer'd."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"'Tis done already, and the messenger gone."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That he his high authority abused,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Demand the like."
III,VI,MECAENAS,"He'll never yield to that."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Nor must not then be yielded to in this."
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That ever I should call thee castaway!"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should have an army for an usher, and"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The neighs of horse to tell of her approach"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Raised by your populous troops: but you are come"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Is often left unloved; we should have met you"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"By sea and land; supplying every stage"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"With an augmented greeting."
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"Good my lord,"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"His pardon for return."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which soon he granted,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him."
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"Do not say so, my lord."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have eyes upon him,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And his affairs come to me on the wind."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Where is he now?"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"My lord, in Athens."
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Up to a whore; who now are levying"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"With a more larger list of sceptres."
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"Ay me, most wretched,"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"That have my heart parted betwixt two friends"
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"That do afflict each other!"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Welcome hither:"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Be you not troubled with the time, which drives"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"O'er your content these strong necessities;"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"But let determined things to destiny"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Nothing more dear to me. You are abused"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To do you justice, make them ministers"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And ever welcome to us."
III,VI,AGRIPPA,"Welcome, lady."
III,VI,MECAENAS,"Welcome, dear madam."
III,VI,MECAENAS,"Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:"
III,VI,MECAENAS,"Only the adulterous Antony, most large"
III,VI,MECAENAS,"In his abominations, turns you off;"
III,VI,MECAENAS,"And gives his potent regiment to a trull,"
III,VI,MECAENAS,"That noises it against us."
III,VI,OCTAVIA,"Is it so, sir?"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,"
III,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"I will be even with thee, doubt it not."
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"But why, why, why?"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"And say'st it is not fit."
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Well, is it, is it?"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"If not denounced against us, why should not we"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"Be there in person?"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If we should serve with horse and mares together,"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A soldier and his horse."
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"What is't you say?"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Take from his heart, take from his brain,"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"from's time,"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"What should not then be spared. He is already"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That Photinus an eunuch and your maids"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Manage this war."
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"Sink Rome, and their tongues rot"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"And, as the president of my kingdom, will"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"I will not stay behind."
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Nay, I have done."
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Here comes the emperor."
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Is it not strange, Canidius,"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"That from Tarentum and Brundusium"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"Celerity is never more admired"
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"Than by the negligent."
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"A good rebuke,"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Which might have well becomed the best of men,"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Will fight with him by sea."
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"By sea! what else?"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Why will my lord do so?"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"For that he dares us to't."
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"So hath my lord dared him to single fight."
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia."
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"And so should you."
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Your ships are not well mann'd;"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Being prepared for land."
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"By sea, by sea."
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Most worthy sir, you therein throw away"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The absolute soldiership you have by land;"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Distract your army, which doth most consist"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The way which promises assurance; and"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,"
III,VII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"From firm security."
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"I'll fight at sea."
III,VII,CLEOPATRA,"I have sixty sails, Caesar none better."
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Our overplus of shipping will we burn;"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"We then can do't at land."
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Thy business?"
III,VII,Messenger,"The news is true, my lord; he is descried;"
III,VII,Messenger,"Caesar has taken Toryne."
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Strange that power should be. Canidius,"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Away, my Thetis!"
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"How now, worthy soldier?"
III,VII,Soldier,"O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;"
III,VII,Soldier,"Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt"
III,VII,Soldier,"This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians"
III,VII,Soldier,"And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we"
III,VII,Soldier,"Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,"
III,VII,Soldier,"And fighting foot to foot."
III,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Well, well: away!"
III,VII,Soldier,"By Hercules, I think I am i' the right."
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"And we are women's men."
III,VII,Soldier,"You keep by land"
III,VII,Soldier,"The legions and the horse whole, do you not?"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Carries beyond belief."
III,VII,Soldier,"While he was yet in Rome,"
III,VII,Soldier,"His power went out in such distractions as"
III,VII,Soldier,"Beguiled all spies."
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Who's his lieutenant, hear you?"
III,VII,Soldier,"They say, one Taurus."
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Well I know the man."
III,VII,Messenger,"The emperor calls Canidius."
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,"
III,VII,CANIDIUS,"Each minute, some."
III,VIII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Taurus!"
III,VIII,TAURUS,"My lord?"
III,VIII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,"
III,VIII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed"
III,VIII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies"
III,VIII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Upon this jump."
III,IX,MARK ANTONY,"Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,"
III,IX,MARK ANTONY,"In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place"
III,IX,MARK ANTONY,"We may the number of the ships behold,"
III,IX,MARK ANTONY,"And so proceed accordingly."
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To see't mine eyes are blasted."
III,X,SCARUS,"Gods and goddesses,"
III,X,SCARUS,"All the whole synod of them!"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"What's thy passion!"
III,X,SCARUS,"The greater cantle of the world is lost"
III,X,SCARUS,"With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away"
III,X,SCARUS,"Kingdoms and provinces."
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"How appears the fight?"
III,X,SCARUS,"On our side like the token'd pestilence,"
III,X,SCARUS,"Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--"
III,X,SCARUS,"Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,"
III,X,SCARUS,"When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,"
III,X,SCARUS,"Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,"
III,X,SCARUS,"The breese upon her, like a cow in June,"
III,X,SCARUS,"Hoists sails and flies."
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That I beheld:"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Endure a further view."
III,X,SCARUS,"She once being loof'd,"
III,X,SCARUS,"The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,"
III,X,SCARUS,"Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,"
III,X,SCARUS,"Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:"
III,X,SCARUS,"I never saw an action of such shame;"
III,X,SCARUS,"Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before"
III,X,SCARUS,"Did violate so itself."
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Alack, alack!"
III,X,CANIDIUS,"Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,"
III,X,CANIDIUS,"And sinks most lamentably. Had our general"
III,X,CANIDIUS,"Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:"
III,X,CANIDIUS,"O, he has given example for our flight,"
III,X,CANIDIUS,"Most grossly, by his own!"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ay, are you thereabouts?"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Why, then, good night indeed."
III,X,CANIDIUS,"Toward Peloponnesus are they fled."
III,X,SCARUS,"'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend"
III,X,SCARUS,"What further comes."
III,X,CANIDIUS,"To Caesar will I render"
III,X,CANIDIUS,"My legions and my horse: six kings already"
III,X,CANIDIUS,"Show me the way of yielding."
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I'll yet follow"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason"
III,X,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Sits in the wind against me."
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"I am so lated in the world, that I"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"And make your peace with Caesar."
III,XI,All,"Fly! not we."
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"I have myself resolved upon a course"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Which has no need of you; be gone:"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"I follow'd that I blush to look upon:"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"My very hairs do mutiny; for the white"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Have letters from me to some friends that will"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Which my despair proclaims; let that be left"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"I will possess you of that ship and treasure."
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by."
III,XI,EROS,"Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him."
III,XI,IRAS,"Do, most dear queen."
III,XI,CHARMIAN,"Do! why: what else?"
III,XI,CLEOPATRA,"Let me sit down. O Juno!"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"No, no, no, no, no."
III,XI,EROS,"See you here, sir?"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"O fie, fie, fie!"
III,XI,CHARMIAN,"Madam!"
III,XI,IRAS,"Madam, O good empress!"
III,XI,EROS,"Sir, sir,--"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"That the mad Brutus ended: he alone"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter."
III,XI,CLEOPATRA,"Ah, stand by."
III,XI,EROS,"The queen, my lord, the queen."
III,XI,IRAS,"Go to him, madam, speak to him:"
III,XI,IRAS,"He is unqualitied with very shame."
III,XI,CLEOPATRA,"Well then, sustain him: O!"
III,XI,EROS,"Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:"
III,XI,EROS,"Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but"
III,XI,EROS,"Your comfort makes the rescue."
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"I have offended reputation,"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"A most unnoble swerving."
III,XI,EROS,"Sir, the queen."
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"How I convey my shame out of thine eyes"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"By looking back what I have left behind"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"'Stroy'd in dishonour."
III,XI,CLEOPATRA,"O my lord, my lord,"
III,XI,CLEOPATRA,"Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought"
III,XI,CLEOPATRA,"You would have follow'd."
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Egypt, thou knew'st too well"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Command me."
III,XI,CLEOPATRA,"O, my pardon!"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Now I must"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"To the young man send humble treaties, dodge"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"And palter in the shifts of lowness; who"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Making and marring fortunes. You did know"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"How much you were my conqueror; and that"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"My sword, made weak by my affection, would"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Obey it on all cause."
III,XI,CLEOPATRA,"Pardon, pardon!"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead."
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows"
III,XI,MARK ANTONY,"We scorn her most when most she offers blows."
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Let him appear that's come from Antony."
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Know you him?"
III,XII,DOLABELLA,"Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:"
III,XII,DOLABELLA,"An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither"
III,XII,DOLABELLA,"He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,"
III,XII,DOLABELLA,"Which had superfluous kings for messengers"
III,XII,DOLABELLA,"Not many moons gone by."
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Approach, and speak."
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"Such as I am, I come from Antony:"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"I was of late as petty to his ends"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"To his grand sea."
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Be't so: declare thine office."
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"He lessens his requests; and to thee sues"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"A private man in Athens: this for him."
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,"
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"Now hazarded to thy grace."
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"For Antony,"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have no ears to his request. The queen"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Or take his life there: this if she perform,"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She shall not sue unheard. So to them both."
III,XII,EUPHRONIUS,"Fortune pursue thee!"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Bring him through the bands."
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And in our name, what she requires; add more,"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"From thine invention, offers: women are not"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Will answer as a law."
III,XII,THYREUS,"Caesar, I go."
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And what thou think'st his very action speaks"
III,XII,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In every power that moves."
III,XII,THYREUS,"Caesar, I shall."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"What shall we do, Enobarbus?"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Think, and die."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Is Antony or we in fault for this?"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Antony only, that would make his will"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Lord of his reason. What though you fled"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"From that great face of war, whose several ranges"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Frighted each other? why should he follow?"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The itch of his affection should not then"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"When half to half the world opposed, he being"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The meered question: 'twas a shame no less"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And leave his navy gazing."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Prithee, peace."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Is that his answer?"
III,XIII,EUPHRONIUS,"Ay, my lord."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"The queen shall then have courtesy, so she"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Will yield us up."
III,XIII,EUPHRONIUS,"He says so."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Let her know't."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And he will fill thy wishes to the brim"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"With principalities."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"That head, my lord?"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"To him again: tell him he wears the rose"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Of youth upon him; from which the world should note"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Under the service of a child as soon"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"To lay his gay comparisons apart,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And answer me declined, sword against sword,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me."
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Do draw the inward quality after them,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To suffer all alike. That he should dream,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"His judgment too."
III,XIII,Attendant,"A messenger from CAESAR."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"What, no more ceremony? See, my women!"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Against the blown rose may they stop their nose"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir."
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The loyalty well held to fools does make"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Does conquer him that did his master conquer"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And earns a place i' the story."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Caesar's will?"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Hear it apart."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"None but friends: say boldly."
III,XIII,THYREUS,"So, haply, are they friends to Antony."
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's."
III,XIII,THYREUS,"So."
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Further than he is Caesar."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Go on: right royal."
III,XIII,THYREUS,"He knows that you embrace not Antony"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"As you did love, but as you fear'd him."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"O!"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"The scars upon your honour, therefore, he"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Does pity, as constrained blemishes,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Not as deserved."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"He is a god, and knows"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"But conquer'd merely."
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Thy dearest quit thee."
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Shall I say to Caesar"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"What you require of him? for he partly begs"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"To be desired to give. It much would please him,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"That of his fortunes you should make a staff"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"To hear from me you had left Antony,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"And put yourself under his shrowd,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"The universal landlord."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"What's your name?"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"My name is Thyreus."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Most kind messenger,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Say to great Caesar this: in deputation"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"The doom of Egypt."
III,XIII,THYREUS,"'Tis your noblest course."
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Wisdom and fortune combating together,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"If that the former dare but what it can,"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"My duty on your hand."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Your Caesar's father oft,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"As it rain'd kisses."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Favours, by Jove that thunders!"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"What art thou, fellow?"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"One that but performs"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest"
III,XIII,THYREUS,"To have command obey'd."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"and devils!"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Antony yet."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Take hence this Jack, and whip him."
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Than with an old one dying."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Moon and stars!"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence."
III,XIII,THYREUS,"Mark Antony!"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Tug him away: being whipp'd,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Bear us an errand to him."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Forborne the getting of a lawful race,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And by a gem of women, to be abused"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"By one that looks on feeders?"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Good my lord,--"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"You have been a boggler ever:"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"But when we in our viciousness grow hard--"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"To our confusion."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"O, is't come to this?"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"I found you as a morsel cold upon"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Though you can guess what temperance should be,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"You know not what it is."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Wherefore is this?"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"To let a fellow that will take rewards"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"The horned herd! for I have savage cause;"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And to proclaim it civilly, were like"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"For being yare about him."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Is he whipp'd?"
III,XIII,First Attendant,"Soundly, my lord."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?"
III,XIII,First Attendant,"He did ask favour."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"If that thy father live, let him repent"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"To follow Caesar in his triumph, since"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"The white hand of a lady fever thee,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"He makes me angry with him; for he seems"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"When my good stars, that were my former guides,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"My speech and what is done, tell him he has"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Hence with thy stripes, begone!"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Have you done yet?"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Alack, our terrene moon"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"The fall of Antony!"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"I must stay his time."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"With one that ties his points?"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Not know me yet?"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Cold-hearted toward me?"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Ah, dear, if I be so,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"And poison it in the source; and the first stone"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Drop in my neck: as it determines, so"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Till by degrees the memory of my womb,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Together with my brave Egyptians all,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"By the discandying of this pelleted storm,"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Have buried them for prey!"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"I am satisfied."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"I will oppose his fate. Our force by land"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"If from the field I shall return once more"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"I and my sword will earn our chronicle:"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"There's hope in't yet."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"That's my brave lord!"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And fight maliciously: for when mine hours"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Let's mock the midnight bell."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"It is my birth-day:"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord"
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"We will yet do well."
III,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Call all his noble captains to my lord."
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"I'll make death love me; for I will contend"
III,XIII,MARK ANTONY,"Even with his pestilent scythe."
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A diminution in our captain's brain"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek"
III,XIII,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Some way to leave him."
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have many other ways to die; meantime"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Laugh at his challenge."
IV,I,MECAENAS,"Caesar must think,"
IV,I,MECAENAS,"When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted"
IV,I,MECAENAS,"Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now"
IV,I,MECAENAS,"Make boot of his distraction: never anger"
IV,I,MECAENAS,"Made good guard for itself."
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Let our best heads"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"We mean to fight: within our files there are,"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of those that served Mark Antony but late,"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Enough to fetch him in. See it done:"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And feast the army; we have store to do't,"
IV,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"He will not fight with me, Domitius."
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"No."
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Why should he not?"
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,"
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"He is twenty men to one."
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"To-morrow, soldier,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Or bathe my dying honour in the blood"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?"
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Well said; come on."
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Call forth my household servants: let's to-night"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Be bounteous at our meal."
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Give me thy hand,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"And kings have been your fellows."
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"tricks which sorrow shoots"
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Out of the mind."
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"And thou art honest too."
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"I wish I could be made so many men,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"And all of you clapp'd up together in"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"An Antony, that I might do you service"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"So good as you have done."
IV,II,All,"The gods forbid!"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Scant not my cups; and make as much of me"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"As when mine empire was your fellow too,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"And suffer'd my command."
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Tend me to-night;"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"May be it is the period of your duty:"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Haply you shall not see me more; or if,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"You'll serve another master. I look on you"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"I turn you not away; but, like a master"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Married to your good service, stay till death:"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"And the gods yield you for't!"
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"What mean you, sir,"
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;"
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,"
IV,II,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Transform us not to women."
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Ho, ho, ho!"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Grace grow where those drops fall!"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"My hearty friends,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"You take me in too dolorous a sense;"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Where rather I'll expect victorious life"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,"
IV,II,MARK ANTONY,"And drown consideration."
IV,III,First Soldier,"Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day."
IV,III,Second Soldier,"It will determine one way: fare you well."
IV,III,Second Soldier,"Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?"
IV,III,First Soldier,"Nothing. What news?"
IV,III,Second Soldier,"Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you."
IV,III,First Soldier,"Well, sir, good night."
IV,III,Second Soldier,"Soldiers, have careful watch."
IV,III,Third Soldier,"And you. Good night, good night."
IV,III,Fourth Soldier,"Here we: and if to-morrow"
IV,III,Fourth Soldier,"Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope"
IV,III,Fourth Soldier,"Our landmen will stand up."
IV,III,Third Soldier,"'Tis a brave army,"
IV,III,Third Soldier,"And full of purpose."
IV,III,Fourth Soldier,"Peace! what noise?"
IV,III,First Soldier,"List, list!"
IV,III,Second Soldier,"Hark!"
IV,III,First Soldier,"Music i' the air."
IV,III,Third Soldier,"Under the earth."
IV,III,Fourth Soldier,"It signs well, does it not?"
IV,III,Third Soldier,"No."
IV,III,First Soldier,"Peace, I say!"
IV,III,First Soldier,"What should this mean?"
IV,III,Second Soldier,"'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,"
IV,III,Second Soldier,"Now leaves him."
IV,III,First Soldier,"Walk; let's see if other watchmen"
IV,III,First Soldier,"Do hear what we do?"
IV,III,Second Soldier,"How now, masters!"
IV,III,All,"How now! do you hear this?"
IV,III,First Soldier,"Ay; is't not strange?"
IV,III,Third Soldier,"Do you hear, masters? do you hear?"
IV,III,First Soldier,"Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;"
IV,III,First Soldier,"Let's see how it will give off."
IV,III,All,"Content. 'Tis strange."
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Eros! mine armour, Eros!"
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"Sleep a little."
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Come good fellow, put mine iron on:"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"If fortune be not ours to-day, it is"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Because we brave her: come."
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, I'll help too."
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"What's this for?"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Ah, let be, let be! thou art"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this."
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be."
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Well, well;"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Go put on thy defences."
IV,IV,EROS,"Briefly, sir."
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"Is not this buckled well?"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Rarely, rarely:"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"He that unbuckles this, till we do please"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm."
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"The royal occupation! thou shouldst see"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"A workman in't."
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Good morrow to thee; welcome:"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"To business that we love we rise betime,"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"And go to't with delight."
IV,IV,Soldier,"A thousand, sir,"
IV,IV,Soldier,"Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,"
IV,IV,Soldier,"And at the port expect you."
IV,IV,Captain,"The morn is fair. Good morrow, general."
IV,IV,All,"Good morrow, general."
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"'Tis well blown, lads:"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"This morning, like the spirit of a youth"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"That means to be of note, begins betimes."
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said."
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,"
IV,IV,MARK ANTONY,"Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu."
IV,IV,CHARMIAN,"Please you, retire to your chamber."
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"Lead me."
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might"
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"Determine this great war in single fight!"
IV,IV,CLEOPATRA,"Then Antony,--but now--Well, on."
IV,V,Soldier,"The gods make this a happy day to Antony!"
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd"
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"To make me fight at land!"
IV,V,Soldier,"Hadst thou done so,"
IV,V,Soldier,"The kings that have revolted, and the soldier"
IV,V,Soldier,"That has this morning left thee, would have still"
IV,V,Soldier,"Follow'd thy heels."
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"Who's gone this morning?"
IV,V,Soldier,"Who!"
IV,V,Soldier,"One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,"
IV,V,Soldier,"He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp"
IV,V,Soldier,"Say 'I am none of thine.'"
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"What say'st thou?"
IV,V,Soldier,"Sir,"
IV,V,Soldier,"He is with Caesar."
IV,V,EROS,"Sir, his chests and treasure"
IV,V,EROS,"He has not with him."
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"Is he gone?"
IV,V,Soldier,"Most certain."
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;"
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--"
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;"
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"Say that I wish he never find more cause"
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"To change a master. O, my fortunes have"
IV,V,MARK ANTONY,"Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!"
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:"
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our will is Antony be took alive;"
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Make it so known."
IV,VI,AGRIPPA,"Caesar, I shall."
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The time of universal peace is near:"
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world"
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Shall bear the olive freely."
IV,VI,Messenger,"Antony"
IV,VI,Messenger,"Is come into the field."
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Go charge Agrippa"
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Plant those that have revolted in the van,"
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That Antony may seem to spend his fury"
IV,VI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Upon himself."
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Affairs of Antony; there did persuade"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And leave his master Antony: for this pains"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That fell away have entertainment, but"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"No honourable trust. I have done ill;"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That I will joy no more."
IV,VI,Soldier,"Enobarbus, Antony"
IV,VI,Soldier,"Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with"
IV,VI,Soldier,"His bounty overplus: the messenger"
IV,VI,Soldier,"Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now"
IV,VI,Soldier,"Unloading of his mules."
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I give it you."
IV,VI,Soldier,"Mock not, Enobarbus."
IV,VI,Soldier,"I tell you true: best you safed the bringer"
IV,VI,Soldier,"Out of the host; I must attend mine office,"
IV,VI,Soldier,"Or would have done't myself. Your emperor"
IV,VI,Soldier,"Continues still a Jove."
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I am alone the villain of the earth,"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And feel I am so most. O Antony,"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"My better service, when my turpitude"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel."
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I fight against thee! No: I will go seek"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits"
IV,VI,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"My latter part of life."
IV,VII,AGRIPPA,"Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:"
IV,VII,AGRIPPA,"Caesar himself has work, and our oppression"
IV,VII,AGRIPPA,"Exceeds what we expected."
IV,VII,SCARUS,"O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!"
IV,VII,SCARUS,"Had we done so at first, we had droven them home"
IV,VII,SCARUS,"With clouts about their heads."
IV,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Thou bleed'st apace."
IV,VII,SCARUS,"I had a wound here that was like a T,"
IV,VII,SCARUS,"But now 'tis made an H."
IV,VII,MARK ANTONY,"They do retire."
IV,VII,SCARUS,"We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet"
IV,VII,SCARUS,"Room for six scotches more."
IV,VII,EROS,"They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves"
IV,VII,EROS,"For a fair victory."
IV,VII,SCARUS,"Let us score their backs,"
IV,VII,SCARUS,"And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:"
IV,VII,SCARUS,"'Tis sport to maul a runner."
IV,VII,MARK ANTONY,"I will reward thee"
IV,VII,MARK ANTONY,"Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold"
IV,VII,MARK ANTONY,"For thy good valour. Come thee on."
IV,VII,SCARUS,"I'll halt after."
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"We have beat him to his camp: run one before,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"For doughty-handed are you, and have fought"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors."
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"The honour'd gashes whole."
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Give me thy hand"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Make her thanks bless thee."
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"O thou day o' the world,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Through proof of harness to my heart, and there"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Ride on the pants triumphing!"
IV,VIII,CLEOPATRA,"Lord of lords!"
IV,VIII,CLEOPATRA,"O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from"
IV,VIII,CLEOPATRA,"The world's great snare uncaught?"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"My nightingale,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"though grey"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"As if a god, in hate of mankind, had"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Destroy'd in such a shape."
IV,VIII,CLEOPATRA,"I'll give thee, friend,"
IV,VIII,CLEOPATRA,"An armour all of gold; it was a king's."
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"He has deserved it, were it carbuncled"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Through Alexandria make a jolly march;"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Had our great palace the capacity"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"To camp this host, we all would sup together,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"And drink carouses to the next day's fate,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"With brazen din blast you the city's ear;"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Make mingle with rattling tabourines;"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,"
IV,VIII,MARK ANTONY,"Applauding our approach."
IV,IX,First Soldier,"If we be not relieved within this hour,"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"We must return to the court of guard: the night"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"By the second hour i' the morn."
IV,IX,Second Soldier,"This last day was"
IV,IX,Second Soldier,"A shrewd one to's."
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"O, bear me witness, night,--"
IV,IX,Third Soldier,"What man is this?"
IV,IX,Second Soldier,"Stand close, and list him."
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"When men revolted shall upon record"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Before thy face repent!"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"Enobarbus!"
IV,IX,Third Soldier,"Peace!"
IV,IX,Third Soldier,"Hark further."
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That life, a very rebel to my will,"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"May hang no longer on me: throw my heart"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Against the flint and hardness of my fault:"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Nobler than my revolt is infamous,"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Forgive me in thine own particular;"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"But let the world rank me in register"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A master-leaver and a fugitive:"
IV,IX,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"O Antony! O Antony!"
IV,IX,Second Soldier,"Let's speak To him."
IV,IX,First Soldier,"Let's hear him, for the things he speaks"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"May concern Caesar."
IV,IX,Third Soldier,"Let's do so. But he sleeps."
IV,IX,First Soldier,"Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"Was never yet for sleep."
IV,IX,Second Soldier,"Go we to him."
IV,IX,Third Soldier,"Awake, sir, awake; speak to us."
IV,IX,Second Soldier,"Hear you, sir?"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"The hand of death hath raught him."
IV,IX,First Soldier,"Hark! the drums"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour"
IV,IX,First Soldier,"Is fully out."
IV,IX,Third Soldier,"Come on, then;"
IV,IX,Third Soldier,"He may recover yet."
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"Their preparation is to-day by sea;"
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"We please them not by land."
IV,X,SCARUS,"For both, my lord."
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;"
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot"
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the hills adjoining to the city"
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;"
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"They have put forth the haven"
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"Where their appointment we may best discover,"
IV,X,MARK ANTONY,"And look on their endeavour."
IV,XI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"But being charged, we will be still by land,"
IV,XI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force"
IV,XI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,"
IV,XI,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And hold our best advantage."
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"does stand,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Straight, how 'tis like to go."
IV,XII,SCARUS,"Swallows have built"
IV,XII,SCARUS,"In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers"
IV,XII,SCARUS,"Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,"
IV,XII,SCARUS,"And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony"
IV,XII,SCARUS,"Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,"
IV,XII,SCARUS,"His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,"
IV,XII,SCARUS,"Of what he has, and has not."
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"All is lost;"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"They cast their caps up and carouse together"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"'tis thou"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"For when I am revenged upon my charm,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone."
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Fortune and Antony part here; even here"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Beguiled me to the very heart of loss."
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"What, Eros, Eros!"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!"
IV,XII,CLEOPATRA,"Why is my lord enraged against his love?"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Patient Octavia plough thy visage up"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"With her prepared nails."
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"'Tis well thou'rt gone,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"If it be well to live; but better 'twere"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall"
IV,XII,MARK ANTONY,"Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!"
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Help me, my women! O, he is more mad"
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly"
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Was never so emboss'd."
IV,XIII,CHARMIAN,"To the monument!"
IV,XIII,CHARMIAN,"There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead."
IV,XIII,CHARMIAN,"The soul and body rive not more in parting"
IV,XIII,CHARMIAN,"Than greatness going off."
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"To the monument!"
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;"
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'"
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,"
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"And bring me how he takes my death."
IV,XIII,CLEOPATRA,"To the monument!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Eros, thou yet behold'st me?"
IV,XIV,EROS,"Ay, noble lord."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"A forked mountain, or blue promontory"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"these signs;"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"They are black vesper's pageants."
IV,XIV,EROS,"Ay, my lord,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"That which is now a horse, even with a thought"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"As water is in water."
IV,XIV,EROS,"It does, my lord."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"My good knave Eros, now thy captain is"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Even such a body: here I am Antony:"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Unto an enemy's triumph."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Ourselves to end ourselves."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"O! thy vile lady!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"She has robb'd me of my sword."
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"No, Antony;"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"With thine entirely."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"She hath betray'd me and shall die the death."
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"Death of one person can be paid but once,"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"Then in the midst a tearing groan did break"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"The name of Antony; it was divided"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"Thy name so buried in her."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Dead, then?"
IV,XIV,MARDIAN,"Dead."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"And we must sleep."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"That thou depart'st hence safe,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Does pay thy labour richly; go."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Off, pluck off:"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"You have been nobly borne. From me awhile."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"All length is torture: since the torch is out,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!"
IV,XIV,EROS,"What would my lord?"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Since Cleopatra died,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"The courage of a woman; less noble mind"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Than she which by her death our Caesar tells"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"That, when the exigent should come, which now"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Is come indeed, when I should see behind me"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"The inevitable prosecution of"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Put colour in thy cheek."
IV,XIV,EROS,"The gods withhold me!"
IV,XIV,EROS,"Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,"
IV,XIV,EROS,"Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Eros,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"His corrigible neck, his face subdued"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"His baseness that ensued?"
IV,XIV,EROS,"I would not see't."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Most useful for thy country."
IV,XIV,EROS,"O, sir, pardon me!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Or thy precedent services are all"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come."
IV,XIV,EROS,"Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,"
IV,XIV,EROS,"Wherein the worship of the whole world lies."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Lo thee!"
IV,XIV,EROS,"My sword is drawn."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Then let it do at once"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"The thing why thou hast drawn it."
IV,XIV,EROS,"My dear master,"
IV,XIV,EROS,"My captain, and my emperor, let me say,"
IV,XIV,EROS,"Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"'Tis said, man; and farewell."
IV,XIV,EROS,"Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Now, Eros."
IV,XIV,EROS,"Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow"
IV,XIV,EROS,"Of Antony's death."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Thrice-nobler than myself!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Have by their brave instruction got upon me"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"A nobleness in record: but I will be"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"A bridegroom in my death, and run into't"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!"
IV,XIV,First Guard,"What's the noise?"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Of what I have begun."
IV,XIV,Second Guard,"The star is fall'n."
IV,XIV,First Guard,"And time is at his period."
IV,XIV,All,"Alas, and woe!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Let him that loves me strike me dead."
IV,XIV,First Guard,"Not I."
IV,XIV,Second Guard,"Nor I."
IV,XIV,Third Guard,"Nor any one."
IV,XIV,DERCETAS,"Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly."
IV,XIV,DERCETAS,"This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,"
IV,XIV,DERCETAS,"Shall enter me with him."
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Where's Antony?"
IV,XIV,DERCETAS,"There, Diomed there."
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Lives he?"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Wilt thou not answer, man?"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Sufficing strokes for death."
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Most absolute lord,"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"When did she send thee?"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Now, my lord."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Where is she?"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Which never shall be found--you did suspect"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"I dread, too late."
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee."
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!"
IV,XIV,DIOMEDES,"Come, your lord calls!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"'Tis the last service that I shall command you."
IV,XIV,First Guard,"Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear"
IV,XIV,First Guard,"All your true followers out."
IV,XIV,All,"Most heavy day!"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Which comes to punish us, and we punish it"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,"
IV,XIV,MARK ANTONY,"And have my thanks for all."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"O Charmian, I will never go from hence."
IV,XV,CHARMIAN,"Be comforted, dear madam."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"No, I will not:"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"All strange and terrible events are welcome,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"As that which makes it."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"How now! is he dead?"
IV,XV,DIOMEDES,"His death's upon him, but not dead."
IV,XV,DIOMEDES,"Look out o' the other side your monument;"
IV,XV,DIOMEDES,"His guard have brought him thither."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"O sun,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Burn the great sphere thou movest in!"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"darkling stand"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Help, friends below; let's draw him hither."
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Peace!"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"So it should be, that none but Antony"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"I am dying, Egypt, dying; only"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"I here importune death awhile, until"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Of many thousand kisses the poor last"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"I lay up thy lips."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"I dare not, dear,--"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Lest I be taken: not the imperious show"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"serpents, have"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Assist, good friends."
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"O, quick, or I am gone."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Our strength is all gone into heaviness,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Thus would I wear them out."
IV,XV,All,"A heavy sight!"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"I am dying, Egypt, dying:"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Give me some wine, and let me speak a little."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Provoked by my offence."
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"One word, sweet queen:"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"They do not go together."
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Gentle, hear me:"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"None about Caesar trust but Proculeius."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"My resolution and my hands I'll trust;"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"None about Caesar."
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"The miserable change now at my end"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"In feeding them with those my former fortunes"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"The noblest; and do now not basely die,"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Not cowardly put off my helmet to"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;"
IV,XV,MARK ANTONY,"I can no more."
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Noblest of men, woo't die?"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"In this dull world, which in thy absence is"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"No better than a sty? O, see, my women,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"O, wither'd is the garland of the war,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Are level now with men; the odds is gone,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"And there is nothing left remarkable"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Beneath the visiting moon."
IV,XV,CHARMIAN,"O, quietness, lady!"
IV,XV,IRAS,"She is dead too, our sovereign."
IV,XV,CHARMIAN,"Lady!"
IV,XV,IRAS,"Madam!"
IV,XV,CHARMIAN,"O madam, madam, madam!"
IV,XV,IRAS,"Royal Egypt, Empress!"
IV,XV,CHARMIAN,"Peace, peace, Iras!"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"By such poor passion as the maid that milks"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"And does the meanest chares. It were for me"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"To tell them that this world did equal theirs"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Patience is scottish, and impatience does"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"To rush into the secret house of death,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"what's noble,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"And make death proud to take us. Come, away:"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"This case of that huge spirit now is cold:"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend"
IV,XV,CLEOPATRA,"But resolution, and the briefest end."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The pauses that he makes."
V,I,DOLABELLA,"Caesar, I shall."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Appear thus to us?"
V,I,DERCETAS,"I am call'd Dercetas;"
V,I,DERCETAS,"Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy"
V,I,DERCETAS,"Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,"
V,I,DERCETAS,"He was my master; and I wore my life"
V,I,DERCETAS,"To spend upon his haters. If thou please"
V,I,DERCETAS,"To take me to thee, as I was to him"
V,I,DERCETAS,"I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,"
V,I,DERCETAS,"I yield thee up my life."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What is't thou say'st?"
V,I,DERCETAS,"I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The breaking of so great a thing should make"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A greater crack: the round world"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should have shook lions into civil streets,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Is not a single doom; in the name lay"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A moiety of the world."
V,I,DERCETAS,"He is dead, Caesar:"
V,I,DERCETAS,"Not by a public minister of justice,"
V,I,DERCETAS,"Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,"
V,I,DERCETAS,"Which writ his honour in the acts it did,"
V,I,DERCETAS,"Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,"
V,I,DERCETAS,"Splitted the heart. This is his sword;"
V,I,DERCETAS,"I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd"
V,I,DERCETAS,"With his most noble blood."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Look you sad, friends?"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To wash the eyes of kings."
V,I,AGRIPPA,"And strange it is,"
V,I,AGRIPPA,"That nature must compel us to lament"
V,I,AGRIPPA,"Our most persisted deeds."
V,I,MECAENAS,"His taints and honours"
V,I,MECAENAS,"Waged equal with him."
V,I,AGRIPPA,"A rarer spirit never"
V,I,AGRIPPA,"Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us"
V,I,AGRIPPA,"Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd."
V,I,MECAENAS,"When such a spacious mirror's set before him,"
V,I,MECAENAS,"He needs must see himself."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"O Antony!"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Have shown to thee such a declining day,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Or look on thine; we could not stall together"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In the whole world: but yet let me lament,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That thou, my brother, my competitor"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In top of all design, my mate in empire,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Friend and companion in the front of war,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The arm of mine own body, and the heart"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Unreconciliable, should divide"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"But I will tell you at some meeter season:"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The business of this man looks out of him;"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?"
V,I,Egyptian,"A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,"
V,I,Egyptian,"Confined in all she has, her monument,"
V,I,Egyptian,"Of thy intents desires instruction,"
V,I,Egyptian,"That she preparedly may frame herself"
V,I,Egyptian,"To the way she's forced to."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Bid her have good heart:"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"How honourable and how kindly we"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To be ungentle."
V,I,Egyptian,"So the gods preserve thee!"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The quality of her passion shall require,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She do defeat us; for her life in Rome"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Would be eternal in our triumph: go,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And with your speediest bring us what she says,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And how you find of her."
V,I,PROCULEIUS,"Caesar, I shall."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Gallus, go you along."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Where's Dolabella,"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To second Proculeius?"
V,I,All,"Dolabella!"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Let him alone, for I remember now"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready."
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Go with me to my tent; where you shall see"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"How hardly I was drawn into this war;"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"How calm and gentle I proceeded still"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In all my writings: go with me, and see"
V,I,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What I can show in this."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"My desolation does begin to make"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"A minister of her will: and it is great"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To do that thing that ends all other deeds;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"The beggar's nurse and Caesar's."
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"And bids thee study on what fair demands"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Thou mean'st to have him grant thee."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"What's thy name?"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"My name is Proculeius."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Antony"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I do not greatly care to be deceived,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That have no use for trusting. If your master"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That majesty, to keep decorum, must"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"No less beg than a kingdom: if he please"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"He gives me so much of mine own, as I"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Will kneel to him with thanks."
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Be of good cheer;"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Make your full reference freely to my lord,"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Who is so full of grace, that it flows over"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"On all that need: let me report to him"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Your sweet dependency; and you shall find"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Where he for grace is kneel'd to."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Pray you, tell him"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"The greatness he has got. I hourly learn"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Look him i' the face."
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"This I'll report, dear lady."
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Of him that caused it."
V,II,GALLUS,"You see how easily she may be surprised:"
V,II,GALLUS,"Guard her till Caesar come."
V,II,IRAS,"Royal queen!"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Quick, quick, good hands."
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Hold, worthy lady, hold:"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Relieved, but not betray'd."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"What, of death too,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That rids our dogs of languish?"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Cleopatra,"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Do not abuse my master's bounty by"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"The undoing of yourself: let the world see"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"His nobleness well acted, which your death"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Will never let come forth."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Where art thou, death?"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Worthy many babes and beggars!"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"O, temperance, lady!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"If idle talk will once be necessary,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Nor once be chastised with the sober eye"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"And show me to the shouting varletry"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Blow me into abhorring! rather make"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"My country's high pyramides my gibbet,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"And hang me up in chains!"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"You do extend"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"These thoughts of horror further than you shall"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"Find cause in Caesar."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Proculeius,"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"I'll take her to my guard."
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"So, Dolabella,"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"It shall content me best: be gentle to her."
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,"
V,II,PROCULEIUS,"If you'll employ me to him."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Say, I would die."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Most noble empress, you have heard of me?"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I cannot tell."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Assuredly you know me."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"No matter, sir, what I have heard or known."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Is't not your trick?"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"I understand not, madam."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"O, such another sleep, that I might see"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"But such another man!"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"If it might please ye,--"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"A sun and moon, which kept their course,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"and lighted"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"The little O, the earth."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Most sovereign creature,--"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Crested the world: his voice was propertied"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That grew the more by reaping: his delights"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"The element they lived in: in his livery"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"As plates dropp'd from his pocket."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Cleopatra!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Think you there was, or might be, such a man"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"As this I dream'd of?"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Gentle madam, no."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"You lie, up to the hearing of the gods."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"But, if there be, or ever were, one such,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Condemning shadows quite."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Hear me, good madam."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"As answering to the weight: would I might never"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"My very heart at root."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I thank you, sir,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Know you what Caesar means to do with me?"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"I am loath to tell you what I would you knew."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, pray you, sir,--"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Though he be honourable,--"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"He'll lead me, then, in triumph?"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Madam, he will; I know't."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which is the Queen of Egypt?"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"It is the emperor, madam."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Arise, you shall not kneel:"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, the gods"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Will have it thus; my master and my lord"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I must obey."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Take to you no hard thoughts:"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The record of what injuries you did us,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Though written in our flesh, we shall remember"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As things but done by chance."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Sole sir o' the world,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I cannot project mine own cause so well"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To make it clear; but do confess I have"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Been laden with like frailties which before"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Have often shamed our sex."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Cleopatra, know,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"We will extenuate rather than enforce:"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If you apply yourself to our intents,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A benefit in this change; but if you seek"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To lay on me a cruelty, by taking"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of my good purposes, and put your children"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To that destruction which I'll guard them from,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?"
V,II,SELEUCUS,"Here, madam."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Upon his peril, that I have reserved"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus."
V,II,SELEUCUS,"Madam,"
V,II,SELEUCUS,"I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,"
V,II,SELEUCUS,"Speak that which is not."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"What have I kept back?"
V,II,SELEUCUS,"Enough to purchase what you have made known."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Your wisdom in the deed."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"See, Caesar! O, behold,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"The ingratitude of this Seleucus does"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"O rarely base!"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Good queen, let us entreat you."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Doing the honour of thy lordliness"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To one so meek, that mine own servant should"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Parcel the sum of my disgraces by"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That I some lady trifles have reserved,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Immoment toys, things of such dignity"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"As we greet modern friends withal; and say,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Some nobler token I have kept apart"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"For Livia and Octavia, to induce"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Their mediation; must I be unfolded"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Beneath the fall I have."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Prithee, go hence;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Thou wouldst have mercy on me."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Forbear, Seleucus."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"For things that others do; and, when we fall,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"We answer others' merits in our name,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Are therefore to be pitied."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Cleopatra,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"For we intend so to dispose you as"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our care and pity is so much upon you,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That we remain your friend; and so, adieu."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"My master, and my lord!"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Not so. Adieu."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian."
V,II,IRAS,"Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,"
V,II,IRAS,"And we are for the dark."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Hie thee again:"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I have spoke already, and it is provided;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Go put it to the haste."
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Madam, I will."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Where is the queen?"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Behold, sir."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Dolabella!"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Which my love makes religion to obey,"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"I tell you this: Caesar through Syria"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Intends his journey; and within three days"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"You with your children will he send before:"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Make your best use of this: I have perform'd"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Your pleasure and my promise."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Dolabella,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I shall remain your debtor."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"I your servant,"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Farewell, and thanks."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Now, Iras, what think'st thou?"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"And forced to drink their vapour."
V,II,IRAS,"The gods forbid!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Extemporally will stage us, and present"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Our Alexandrian revels; Antony"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I' the posture of a whore."
V,II,IRAS,"O the good gods!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, that's certain."
V,II,IRAS,"I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails"
V,II,IRAS,"Are stronger than mine eyes."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Why, that's the way"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To fool their preparation, and to conquer"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Their most absurd intents."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Now, Charmian!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Wherefore's this noise?"
V,II,Guard,"Here is a rural fellow"
V,II,Guard,"That will not be denied your highness presence:"
V,II,Guard,"He brings you figs."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Let him come in."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"What poor an instrument"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"My resolution's placed, and I have nothing"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Of woman in me: now from head to foot"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"No planet is of mine."
V,II,Guard,"This is the man."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Avoid, and leave him."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That kills and pains not?"
V,II,Clown,"Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party"
V,II,Clown,"that should desire you to touch him, for his biting"
V,II,Clown,"is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or"
V,II,Clown,"never recover."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Rememberest thou any that have died on't?"
V,II,Clown,"Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of"
V,II,Clown,"them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,"
V,II,Clown,"but something given to lie; as a woman should not"
V,II,Clown,"do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the"
V,II,Clown,"biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes"
V,II,Clown,"a very good report o' the worm; but he that will"
V,II,Clown,"believe all that they say, shall never be saved by"
V,II,Clown,"half that they do: but this is most fallible, the"
V,II,Clown,"worm's an odd worm."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Get thee hence; farewell."
V,II,Clown,"I wish you all joy of the worm."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Farewell."
V,II,Clown,"You must think this, look you, that the worm will"
V,II,Clown,"do his kind."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Ay, ay; farewell."
V,II,Clown,"Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the"
V,II,Clown,"keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no"
V,II,Clown,"goodness in worm."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Take thou no care; it shall be heeded."
V,II,Clown,"Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is"
V,II,Clown,"not worth the feeding."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Will it eat me?"
V,II,Clown,"You must not think I am so simple but I know the"
V,II,Clown,"devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a"
V,II,Clown,"woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her"
V,II,Clown,"not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the"
V,II,Clown,"gods great harm in their women; for in every ten"
V,II,Clown,"that they make, the devils mar five."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Well, get thee gone; farewell."
V,II,Clown,"Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Immortal longings in me: now no more"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Antony call; I see him rouse himself"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To praise my noble act; I hear him mock"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Now to that name my courage prove my title!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I am fire and air; my other elements"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"I give to baser life. So; have you done?"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"If thou and nature can so gently part,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"It is not worth leave-taking."
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"The gods themselves do weep!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"This proves me base:"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"If she first meet the curled Antony,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"mortal wretch,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Unpolicied!"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"O eastern star!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Peace, peace!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"That sucks the nurse asleep?"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"O, break! O, break!"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--"
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too."
V,II,CLEOPATRA,"What should I stay--"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"In this vile world? So, fare thee well."
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"And golden Phoebus never be beheld"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"I'll mend it, and then play."
V,II,First Guard,"Where is the queen?"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Speak softly, wake her not."
V,II,First Guard,"Caesar hath sent--"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Too slow a messenger."
V,II,CHARMIAN,"O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee."
V,II,First Guard,"Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled."
V,II,Second Guard,"There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him."
V,II,First Guard,"What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"It is well done, and fitting for a princess"
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Descended of so many royal kings."
V,II,CHARMIAN,"Ah, soldier!"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"How goes it here?"
V,II,Second Guard,"All dead."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Caesar, thy thoughts"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"So sought'st to hinder."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"O sir, you are too sure an augurer;"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"That you did fear is done."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Bravest at the last,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I do not see them bleed."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Who was last with them?"
V,II,First Guard,"A simple countryman, that brought her figs:"
V,II,First Guard,"This was his basket."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Poison'd, then."
V,II,First Guard,"O Caesar,"
V,II,First Guard,"This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:"
V,II,First Guard,"I found her trimming up the diadem"
V,II,First Guard,"On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood"
V,II,First Guard,"And on the sudden dropp'd."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"O noble weakness!"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As she would catch another Antony"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In her strong toil of grace."
V,II,DOLABELLA,"Here, on her breast,"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"There is a vent of blood and something blown:"
V,II,DOLABELLA,"The like is on her arm."
V,II,First Guard,"This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves"
V,II,First Guard,"Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves"
V,II,First Guard,"Upon the caves of Nile."
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Most probable"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That so she died; for her physician tells me"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She hath pursued conclusions infinite"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And bear her women from the monument:"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She shall be buried by her Antony:"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"No grave upon the earth shall clip in it"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A pair so famous. High events as these"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Strike those that make them; and their story is"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"No less in pity than his glory which"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In solemn show attend this funeral;"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see"
V,II,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"High order in this great solemnity."
