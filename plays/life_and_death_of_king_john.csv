I,I,KING JOHN,"Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?"
I,I,CHATILLON,"Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France"
I,I,CHATILLON,"In my behavior to the majesty,"
I,I,CHATILLON,"The borrow'd majesty, of England here."
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Silence, good mother; hear the embassy."
I,I,CHATILLON,"Philip of France, in right and true behalf"
I,I,CHATILLON,"Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,"
I,I,CHATILLON,"Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim"
I,I,CHATILLON,"To this fair island and the territories,"
I,I,CHATILLON,"To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,"
I,I,CHATILLON,"Desiring thee to lay aside the sword"
I,I,CHATILLON,"Which sways usurpingly these several titles,"
I,I,CHATILLON,"And put these same into young Arthur's hand,"
I,I,CHATILLON,"Thy nephew and right royal sovereign."
I,I,KING JOHN,"What follows if we disallow of this?"
I,I,CHATILLON,"The proud control of fierce and bloody war,"
I,I,CHATILLON,"To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld."
I,I,KING JOHN,"Here have we war for war and blood for blood,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Controlment for controlment: so answer France."
I,I,CHATILLON,"Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,"
I,I,CHATILLON,"The farthest limit of my embassy."
I,I,KING JOHN,"Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;"
I,I,KING JOHN,"For ere thou canst report I will be there,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:"
I,I,KING JOHN,"So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath"
I,I,KING JOHN,"And sullen presage of your own decay."
I,I,KING JOHN,"An honourable conduct let him have:"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon."
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"What now, my son! have I not ever said"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"How that ambitious Constance would not cease"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Till she had kindled France and all the world,"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Upon the right and party of her son?"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"This might have been prevented and made whole"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"With very easy arguments of love,"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Which now the manage of two kingdoms must"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"With fearful bloody issue arbitrate."
I,I,KING JOHN,"Our strong possession and our right for us."
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Your strong possession much more than your right,"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Or else it must go wrong with you and me:"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"So much my conscience whispers in your ear,"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear."
I,I,ESSEX,"My liege, here is the strangest controversy"
I,I,ESSEX,"Come from country to be judged by you,"
I,I,ESSEX,"That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Let them approach."
I,I,KING JOHN,"Our abbeys and our priories shall pay"
I,I,KING JOHN,"This expedition's charge."
I,I,KING JOHN,"What men are you?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Your faithful subject I, a gentleman"
I,I,BASTARD,"Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,"
I,I,BASTARD,"As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,"
I,I,BASTARD,"A soldier, by the honour-giving hand"
I,I,BASTARD,"Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field."
I,I,KING JOHN,"What art thou?"
I,I,ROBERT,"The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge."
I,I,KING JOHN,"Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?"
I,I,KING JOHN,"You came not of one mother then, it seems."
I,I,BASTARD,"Most certain of one mother, mighty king;"
I,I,BASTARD,"That is well known; and, as I think, one father:"
I,I,BASTARD,"But for the certain knowledge of that truth"
I,I,BASTARD,"I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Of that I doubt, as all men's children may."
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"And wound her honour with this diffidence."
I,I,BASTARD,"I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;"
I,I,BASTARD,"That is my brother's plea and none of mine;"
I,I,BASTARD,"The which if he can prove, a' pops me out"
I,I,BASTARD,"At least from fair five hundred pound a year:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!"
I,I,KING JOHN,"A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?"
I,I,BASTARD,"I know not why, except to get the land."
I,I,BASTARD,"But once he slander'd me with bastardy:"
I,I,BASTARD,"But whether I be as true begot or no,"
I,I,BASTARD,"That still I lay upon my mother's head,"
I,I,BASTARD,"But that I am as well begot, my liege,--"
I,I,BASTARD,"Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--"
I,I,BASTARD,"Compare our faces and be judge yourself."
I,I,BASTARD,"If old sir Robert did beget us both"
I,I,BASTARD,"And were our father and this son like him,"
I,I,BASTARD,"O old sir Robert, father, on my knee"
I,I,BASTARD,"I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"The accent of his tongue affecteth him."
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Do you not read some tokens of my son"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"In the large composition of this man?"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Mine eye hath well examined his parts"
I,I,KING JOHN,"And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"What doth move you to claim your brother's land?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Because he hath a half-face, like my father."
I,I,BASTARD,"With half that face would he have all my land:"
I,I,BASTARD,"A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!"
I,I,ROBERT,"My gracious liege, when that my father lived,"
I,I,ROBERT,"Your brother did employ my father much,--"
I,I,BASTARD,"Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother."
I,I,ROBERT,"And once dispatch'd him in an embassy"
I,I,ROBERT,"To Germany, there with the emperor"
I,I,ROBERT,"To treat of high affairs touching that time."
I,I,ROBERT,"The advantage of his absence took the king"
I,I,ROBERT,"And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;"
I,I,ROBERT,"Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,"
I,I,ROBERT,"But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores"
I,I,ROBERT,"Between my father and my mother lay,"
I,I,ROBERT,"As I have heard my father speak himself,"
I,I,ROBERT,"When this same lusty gentleman was got."
I,I,ROBERT,"Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd"
I,I,ROBERT,"His lands to me, and took it on his death"
I,I,ROBERT,"That this my mother's son was none of his;"
I,I,ROBERT,"And if he were, he came into the world"
I,I,ROBERT,"Full fourteen weeks before the course of time."
I,I,ROBERT,"Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,"
I,I,ROBERT,"My father's land, as was my father's will."
I,I,KING JOHN,"Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"And if she did play false, the fault was hers;"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands"
I,I,KING JOHN,"That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Had of your father claim'd this son for his?"
I,I,KING JOHN,"In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept"
I,I,KING JOHN,"This calf bred from his cow from all the world;"
I,I,KING JOHN,"In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"My brother might not claim him; nor your father,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;"
I,I,KING JOHN,"My mother's son did get your father's heir;"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Your father's heir must have your father's land."
I,I,ROBERT,"Shall then my father's will be of no force"
I,I,ROBERT,"To dispossess that child which is not his?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Than was his will to get me, as I think."
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Lord of thy presence and no land beside?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Madam, an if my brother had my shape,"
I,I,BASTARD,"And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;"
I,I,BASTARD,"And if my legs were two such riding-rods,"
I,I,BASTARD,"My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin"
I,I,BASTARD,"That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose"
I,I,BASTARD,"Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'"
I,I,BASTARD,"And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Would I might never stir from off this place,"
I,I,BASTARD,"I would give it every foot to have this face;"
I,I,BASTARD,"I would not be sir Nob in any case."
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"I am a soldier and now bound to France."
I,I,BASTARD,"Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance."
I,I,BASTARD,"Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear."
I,I,BASTARD,"Madam, I'll follow you unto the death."
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Nay, I would have you go before me thither."
I,I,BASTARD,"Our country manners give our betters way."
I,I,KING JOHN,"What is thy name?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son."
I,I,KING JOHN,"From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,"
I,I,KING JOHN,"Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet."
I,I,BASTARD,"Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:"
I,I,BASTARD,"My father gave me honour, yours gave land."
I,I,BASTARD,"Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,"
I,I,BASTARD,"When I was got, sir Robert was away!"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"The very spirit of Plantagenet!"
I,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so."
I,I,BASTARD,"Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Something about, a little from the right,"
I,I,BASTARD,"In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,"
I,I,BASTARD,"And have is have, however men do catch:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Near or far off, well won is still well shot,"
I,I,BASTARD,"And I am I, howe'er I was begot."
I,I,KING JOHN,"Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;"
I,I,KING JOHN,"A landless knight makes thee a landed squire."
I,I,KING JOHN,"Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed"
I,I,KING JOHN,"For France, for France, for it is more than need."
I,I,BASTARD,"Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!"
I,I,BASTARD,"For thou wast got i' the way of honesty."
I,I,BASTARD,"A foot of honour better than I was;"
I,I,BASTARD,"But many a many foot of land the worse."
I,I,BASTARD,"Well, now can I make any Joan a lady."
I,I,BASTARD,"'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--"
I,I,BASTARD,"And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;"
I,I,BASTARD,"For new-made honour doth forget men's names;"
I,I,BASTARD,"'Tis too respective and too sociable"
I,I,BASTARD,"For your conversion. Now your traveller,"
I,I,BASTARD,"He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,"
I,I,BASTARD,"And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Why then I suck my teeth and catechise"
I,I,BASTARD,"My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'"
I,I,BASTARD,"Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,"
I,I,BASTARD,"'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;"
I,I,BASTARD,"And then comes answer like an Absey book:"
I,I,BASTARD,"'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;"
I,I,BASTARD,"At your employment; at your service, sir;'"
I,I,BASTARD,"'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'"
I,I,BASTARD,"And so, ere answer knows what question would,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Saving in dialogue of compliment,"
I,I,BASTARD,"And talking of the Alps and Apennines,"
I,I,BASTARD,"The Pyrenean and the river Po,"
I,I,BASTARD,"It draws toward supper in conclusion so."
I,I,BASTARD,"But this is worshipful society"
I,I,BASTARD,"And fits the mounting spirit like myself,"
I,I,BASTARD,"For he is but a bastard to the time"
I,I,BASTARD,"That doth not smack of observation;"
I,I,BASTARD,"And so am I, whether I smack or no;"
I,I,BASTARD,"And not alone in habit and device,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Exterior form, outward accoutrement,"
I,I,BASTARD,"But from the inward motion to deliver"
I,I,BASTARD,"Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Which, though I will not practise to deceive,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;"
I,I,BASTARD,"For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising."
I,I,BASTARD,"But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?"
I,I,BASTARD,"What woman-post is this? hath she no husband"
I,I,BASTARD,"That will take pains to blow a horn before her?"
I,I,BASTARD,"O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!"
I,I,BASTARD,"What brings you here to court so hastily?"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"That holds in chase mine honour up and down?"
I,I,BASTARD,"My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou."
I,I,BASTARD,"James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?"
I,I,GURNEY,"Good leave, good Philip."
I,I,BASTARD,"Philip! sparrow: James,"
I,I,BASTARD,"There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more."
I,I,BASTARD,"Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Sir Robert might have eat his part in me"
I,I,BASTARD,"Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:"
I,I,BASTARD,"We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,"
I,I,BASTARD,"To whom am I beholding for these limbs?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Sir Robert never holp to make this leg."
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?"
I,I,BASTARD,"Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like."
I,I,BASTARD,"What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder."
I,I,BASTARD,"But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;"
I,I,BASTARD,"I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;"
I,I,BASTARD,"Legitimation, name and all is gone:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Then, good my mother, let me know my father;"
I,I,BASTARD,"Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?"
I,I,BASTARD,"As faithfully as I deny the devil."
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"By long and vehement suit I was seduced"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"To make room for him in my husband's bed:"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Thou art the issue of my dear offence,"
I,I,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Which was so strongly urged past my defence."
I,I,BASTARD,"Now, by this light, were I to get again,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Madam, I would not wish a better father."
I,I,BASTARD,"Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,"
I,I,BASTARD,"And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Subjected tribute to commanding love,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Against whose fury and unmatched force"
I,I,BASTARD,"The aweless lion could not wage the fight,"
I,I,BASTARD,"Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand."
I,I,BASTARD,"He that perforce robs lions of their hearts"
I,I,BASTARD,"May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,"
I,I,BASTARD,"With all my heart I thank thee for my father!"
I,I,BASTARD,"Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well"
I,I,BASTARD,"When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell."
I,I,BASTARD,"Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;"
I,I,BASTARD,"And they shall say, when Richard me begot,"
I,I,BASTARD,"If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:"
I,I,BASTARD,"Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not."
II,I,LEWIS,"Before Angiers well met, brave Austria."
II,I,LEWIS,"Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,"
II,I,LEWIS,"Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart"
II,I,LEWIS,"And fought the holy wars in Palestine,"
II,I,LEWIS,"By this brave duke came early to his grave:"
II,I,LEWIS,"And for amends to his posterity,"
II,I,LEWIS,"At our importance hither is he come,"
II,I,LEWIS,"To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,"
II,I,LEWIS,"And to rebuke the usurpation"
II,I,LEWIS,"Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:"
II,I,LEWIS,"Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither."
II,I,ARTHUR,"God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death"
II,I,ARTHUR,"The rather that you give his offspring life,"
II,I,ARTHUR,"Shadowing their right under your wings of war:"
II,I,ARTHUR,"I give you welcome with a powerless hand,"
II,I,ARTHUR,"But with a heart full of unstained love:"
II,I,ARTHUR,"Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke."
II,I,LEWIS,"A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"As seal to this indenture of my love,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"That to my home I will no more return,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"And coops from other lands her islanders,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Even till that England, hedged in with the main,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"That water-walled bulwark, still secure"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"And confident from foreign purposes,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Even till that utmost corner of the west"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Will I not think of home, but follow arms."
II,I,CONSTANCE,"O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"To make a more requital to your love!"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"In such a just and charitable war."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Against the brows of this resisting town."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Call for our chiefest men of discipline,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"To cull the plots of best advantages:"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"We'll lay before this town our royal bones,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"But we will make it subject to this boy."
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Stay for an answer to your embassy,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"That right in peace which here we urge in war,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"And then we shall repent each drop of blood"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"That hot rash haste so indirectly shed."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak."
II,I,CHATILLON,"Then turn your forces from this paltry siege"
II,I,CHATILLON,"And stir them up against a mightier task."
II,I,CHATILLON,"England, impatient of your just demands,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time"
II,I,CHATILLON,"To land his legions all as soon as I;"
II,I,CHATILLON,"His marches are expedient to this town,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"His forces strong, his soldiers confident."
II,I,CHATILLON,"With him along is come the mother-queen,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;"
II,I,CHATILLON,"With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;"
II,I,CHATILLON,"With them a bastard of the king's deceased,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"And all the unsettled humours of the land,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"To make hazard of new fortunes here:"
II,I,CHATILLON,"In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits"
II,I,CHATILLON,"Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er"
II,I,CHATILLON,"Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"To do offence and scath in Christendom."
II,I,CHATILLON,"The interruption of their churlish drums"
II,I,CHATILLON,"Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,"
II,I,CHATILLON,"To parley or to fight; therefore prepare."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"How much unlook'd for is this expedition!"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"By how much unexpected, by so much"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"We must awake endavour for defence;"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"For courage mounteth with occasion:"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Let them be welcome then: we are prepared."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Peace be to France, if France in peace permit"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Our just and lineal entrance to our own;"
II,I,KING JOHN,"If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Peace be to England, if that war return"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"From France to England, there to live in peace."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"England we love; and for that England's sake"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"With burden of our armour here we sweat."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"This toil of ours should be a work of thine;"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"But thou from loving England art so far,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Cut off the sequence of posterity,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Out-faced infant state and done a rape"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Upon the maiden virtue of the crown."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"This little abstract doth contain that large"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And this his son; England was Geffrey's right"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"When living blood doth in these temples beat,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?"
II,I,KING JOHN,"From whom hast thou this great commission, France,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"To draw my answer from thy articles?"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"In any breast of strong authority,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"To look into the blots and stains of right:"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And by whose help I mean to chastise it."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Alack, thou dost usurp authority."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Excuse; it is to beat usurping down."
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Let me make answer; thy usurping son."
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"My bed was ever to thy son as true"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"As thine was to thy husband; and this boy"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Liker in feature to his father Geffrey"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Than thou and John in manners; being as like"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"As rain to water, or devil to his dam."
II,I,CONSTANCE,"My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"His father never was so true begot:"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother."
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father."
II,I,CONSTANCE,"There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee."
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Peace!"
II,I,BASTARD,"Hear the crier."
II,I,AUSTRIA,"What the devil art thou?"
II,I,BASTARD,"One that will play the devil, sir, with you,"
II,I,BASTARD,"An a' may catch your hide and you alone:"
II,I,BASTARD,"You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;"
II,I,BASTARD,"I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;"
II,I,BASTARD,"Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith."
II,I,BLANCH,"O, well did he become that lion's robe"
II,I,BLANCH,"That did disrobe the lion of that robe!"
II,I,BASTARD,"It lies as sightly on the back of him"
II,I,BASTARD,"As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:"
II,I,BASTARD,"But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack."
II,I,AUSTRIA,"What craker is this same that deafs our ears"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"With this abundance of superfluous breath?"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Lewis, determine what we shall do straight."
II,I,LEWIS,"Women and fools, break off your conference."
II,I,LEWIS,"King John, this is the very sum of all;"
II,I,LEWIS,"England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,"
II,I,LEWIS,"In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:"
II,I,LEWIS,"Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?"
II,I,KING JOHN,"My life as soon: I do defy thee, France."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And out of my dear love I'll give thee more"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Submit thee, boy."
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Come to thy grandam, child."
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Do, child, go to it grandam, child:"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"There's a good grandam."
II,I,ARTHUR,"Good my mother, peace!"
II,I,ARTHUR,"I would that I were low laid in my grave:"
II,I,ARTHUR,"I am not worth this coil that's made for me."
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps."
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"To do him justice and revenge on you."
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"The dominations, royalties and rights"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Infortunate in nothing but in thee:"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Thy sins are visited in this poor child;"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"The canon of the law is laid on him,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Being but the second generation"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Bedlam, have done."
II,I,CONSTANCE,"I have but this to say,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"That he is not only plagued for her sin,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"But God hath made her sin and her the plague"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"On this removed issue, plague for her"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"And with her plague; her sin his injury,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Her injury the beadle to her sin,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"All punish'd in the person of this child,"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"And all for her; a plague upon her!"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Thou unadvised scold, I can produce"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"A will that bars the title of thy son."
II,I,CONSTANCE,"Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will:"
II,I,CONSTANCE,"A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate:"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"It ill beseems this presence to cry aim"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"To these ill-tuned repetitions."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Some trumpet summon hither to the walls"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's."
II,I,First Citizen,"Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"'Tis France, for England."
II,I,KING JOHN,"England, for itself."
II,I,KING JOHN,"You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--"
II,I,KING JOHN,"For our advantage; therefore hear us first."
II,I,KING JOHN,"These flags of France, that are advanced here"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Before the eye and prospect of your town,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Have hither march'd to your endamagement:"
II,I,KING JOHN,"The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And ready mounted are they to spit forth"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:"
II,I,KING JOHN,"All preparation for a bloody siege"
II,I,KING JOHN,"All merciless proceeding by these French"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And but for our approach those sleeping stones,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"That as a waist doth girdle you about,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"By the compulsion of their ordinance"
II,I,KING JOHN,"By this time from their fixed beds of lime"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made"
II,I,KING JOHN,"For bloody power to rush upon your peace."
II,I,KING JOHN,"But on the sight of us your lawful king,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Who painfully with much expedient march"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Have brought a countercheque before your gates,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"To make a shaking fever in your walls,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"To make a faithless error in your ears:"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Forwearied in this action of swift speed,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Crave harbourage within your city walls."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"When I have said, make answer to us both."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Lo, in this right hand, whose protection"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Is most divinely vow'd upon the right"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Son to the elder brother of this man,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"For this down-trodden equity, we tread"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"In warlike march these greens before your town,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Being no further enemy to you"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Than the constraint of hospitable zeal"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"In the relief of this oppressed child"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Religiously provokes. Be pleased then"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"To pay that duty which you truly owe"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"To that owes it, namely this young prince:"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"We will bear home that lusty blood again"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Which here we came to spout against your town,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And leave your children, wives and you in peace."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Can hide you from our messengers of war,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Though all these English and their discipline"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Were harbour'd in their rude circumference."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"In that behalf which we have challenged it?"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Or shall we give the signal to our rage"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And stalk in blood to our possession?"
II,I,First Citizen,"In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:"
II,I,First Citizen,"For him, and in his right, we hold this town."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Acknowledge then the king, and let me in."
II,I,First Citizen,"That can we not; but he that proves the king,"
II,I,First Citizen,"To him will we prove loyal: till that time"
II,I,First Citizen,"Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Doth not the crown of England prove the king?"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And if not that, I bring you witnesses,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--"
II,I,BASTARD,"Bastards, and else."
II,I,KING JOHN,"To verify our title with their lives."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"As many and as well-born bloods as those,--"
II,I,BASTARD,"Some bastards too."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Stand in his face to contradict his claim."
II,I,First Citizen,"Till you compound whose right is worthiest,"
II,I,First Citizen,"We for the worthiest hold the right from both."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Then God forgive the sin of all those souls"
II,I,KING JOHN,"That to their everlasting residence,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!"
II,I,BASTARD,"Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since"
II,I,BASTARD,"Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Teach us some fence!"
II,I,BASTARD,"Sirrah, were I at home,"
II,I,BASTARD,"At your den, sirrah, with your lioness"
II,I,BASTARD,"I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,"
II,I,BASTARD,"And make a monster of you."
II,I,AUSTRIA,"Peace! no more."
II,I,BASTARD,"O tremble, for you hear the lion roar."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth"
II,I,KING JOHN,"In best appointment all our regiments."
II,I,BASTARD,"Speed then, to take advantage of the field."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"It shall be so; and at the other hill"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Command the rest to stand. God and our right!"
II,I,French Herald,"You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,"
II,I,French Herald,"And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,"
II,I,French Herald,"Who by the hand of France this day hath made"
II,I,French Herald,"Much work for tears in many an English mother,"
II,I,French Herald,"Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;"
II,I,French Herald,"Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,"
II,I,French Herald,"Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;"
II,I,French Herald,"And victory, with little loss, doth play"
II,I,French Herald,"Upon the dancing banners of the French,"
II,I,French Herald,"Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,"
II,I,French Herald,"To enter conquerors and to proclaim"
II,I,French Herald,"Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours."
II,I,English Herald,"Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:"
II,I,English Herald,"King John, your king and England's doth approach,"
II,I,English Herald,"Commander of this hot malicious day:"
II,I,English Herald,"Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,"
II,I,English Herald,"Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;"
II,I,English Herald,"There stuck no plume in any English crest"
II,I,English Herald,"That is removed by a staff of France;"
II,I,English Herald,"Our colours do return in those same hands"
II,I,English Herald,"That did display them when we first march'd forth;"
II,I,English Herald,"And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come"
II,I,English Herald,"Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,"
II,I,English Herald,"Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:"
II,I,English Herald,"Open your gates and gives the victors way."
II,I,First Citizen,"Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,"
II,I,First Citizen,"From first to last, the onset and retire"
II,I,First Citizen,"Of both your armies; whose equality"
II,I,First Citizen,"By our best eyes cannot be censured:"
II,I,First Citizen,"Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;"
II,I,First Citizen,"Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:"
II,I,First Citizen,"Both are alike; and both alike we like."
II,I,First Citizen,"One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,"
II,I,First Citizen,"We hold our town for neither, yet for both."
II,I,KING JOHN,"France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Say, shall the current of our right run on?"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell"
II,I,KING JOHN,"With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Unless thou let his silver water keep"
II,I,KING JOHN,"A peaceful progress to the ocean."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"In this hot trial, more than we of France;"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"That sways the earth this climate overlooks,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Or add a royal number to the dead,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"With slaughter coupled to the name of kings."
II,I,BASTARD,"Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,"
II,I,BASTARD,"When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!"
II,I,BASTARD,"O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;"
II,I,BASTARD,"The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;"
II,I,BASTARD,"And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,"
II,I,BASTARD,"In undetermined differences of kings."
II,I,BASTARD,"Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?"
II,I,BASTARD,"Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,"
II,I,BASTARD,"You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!"
II,I,BASTARD,"Then let confusion of one part confirm"
II,I,BASTARD,"The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?"
II,I,First Citizen,"The king of England; when we know the king."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Know him in us, that here hold up his right."
II,I,KING JOHN,"In us, that are our own great deputy"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And bear possession of our person here,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you."
II,I,First Citizen,"A greater power then we denies all this;"
II,I,First Citizen,"And till it be undoubted, we do lock"
II,I,First Citizen,"Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;"
II,I,First Citizen,"King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Be by some certain king purged and deposed."
II,I,BASTARD,"By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,"
II,I,BASTARD,"And stand securely on their battlements,"
II,I,BASTARD,"As in a theatre, whence they gape and point"
II,I,BASTARD,"At your industrious scenes and acts of death."
II,I,BASTARD,"Your royal presences be ruled by me:"
II,I,BASTARD,"Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend"
II,I,BASTARD,"Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:"
II,I,BASTARD,"By east and west let France and England mount"
II,I,BASTARD,"Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down"
II,I,BASTARD,"The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:"
II,I,BASTARD,"I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Even till unfenced desolation"
II,I,BASTARD,"Leave them as naked as the vulgar air."
II,I,BASTARD,"That done, dissever your united strengths,"
II,I,BASTARD,"And part your mingled colours once again;"
II,I,BASTARD,"Turn face to face and bloody point to point;"
II,I,BASTARD,"Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth"
II,I,BASTARD,"Out of one side her happy minion,"
II,I,BASTARD,"To whom in favour she shall give the day,"
II,I,BASTARD,"And kiss him with a glorious victory."
II,I,BASTARD,"How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?"
II,I,BASTARD,"Smacks it not something of the policy?"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And lay this Angiers even to the ground;"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Then after fight who shall be king of it?"
II,I,BASTARD,"An if thou hast the mettle of a king,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,"
II,I,BASTARD,"As we will ours, against these saucy walls;"
II,I,BASTARD,"And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Why then defy each other and pell-mell"
II,I,BASTARD,"Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?"
II,I,KING JOHN,"We from the west will send destruction"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Into this city's bosom."
II,I,AUSTRIA,"I from the north."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Our thunder from the south"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town."
II,I,BASTARD,"O prudent discipline! From north to south:"
II,I,BASTARD,"Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:"
II,I,BASTARD,"I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!"
II,I,First Citizen,"Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,"
II,I,First Citizen,"And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;"
II,I,First Citizen,"Win you this city without stroke or wound;"
II,I,First Citizen,"Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,"
II,I,First Citizen,"That here come sacrifices for the field:"
II,I,First Citizen,"Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear."
II,I,First Citizen,"That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Is niece to England: look upon the years"
II,I,First Citizen,"Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:"
II,I,First Citizen,"If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?"
II,I,First Citizen,"If zealous love should go in search of virtue,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?"
II,I,First Citizen,"If love ambitious sought a match of birth,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?"
II,I,First Citizen,"Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Is the young Dauphin every way complete:"
II,I,First Citizen,"If not complete of, say he is not she;"
II,I,First Citizen,"And she again wants nothing, to name want,"
II,I,First Citizen,"If want it be not that she is not he:"
II,I,First Citizen,"He is the half part of a blessed man,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Left to be finished by such as she;"
II,I,First Citizen,"And she a fair divided excellence,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Whose fulness of perfection lies in him."
II,I,First Citizen,"O, two such silver currents, when they join,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Do glorify the banks that bound them in;"
II,I,First Citizen,"And two such shores to two such streams made one,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,"
II,I,First Citizen,"To these two princes, if you marry them."
II,I,First Citizen,"This union shall do more than battery can"
II,I,First Citizen,"To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,"
II,I,First Citizen,"With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,"
II,I,First Citizen,"The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,"
II,I,First Citizen,"And give you entrance: but without this match,"
II,I,First Citizen,"The sea enraged is not half so deaf,"
II,I,First Citizen,"Lions more confident, mountains and rocks"
II,I,First Citizen,"More free from motion, no, not Death himself"
II,I,First Citizen,"In moral fury half so peremptory,"
II,I,First Citizen,"As we to keep this city."
II,I,BASTARD,"Here's a stay"
II,I,BASTARD,"That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death"
II,I,BASTARD,"Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,"
II,I,BASTARD,"That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Talks as familiarly of roaring lions"
II,I,BASTARD,"As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!"
II,I,BASTARD,"What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?"
II,I,BASTARD,"He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;"
II,I,BASTARD,"He gives the bastinado with his tongue:"
II,I,BASTARD,"Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his"
II,I,BASTARD,"But buffets better than a fist of France:"
II,I,BASTARD,"Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words"
II,I,BASTARD,"Since I first call'd my brother's father dad."
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Give with our niece a dowry large enough:"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit."
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"I see a yielding in the looks of France;"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Are capable of this ambition,"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,"
II,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Cool and congeal again to what it was."
II,I,First Citizen,"Why answer not the double majesties"
II,I,First Citizen,"This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Speak England first, that hath been forward first"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"To speak unto this city: what say you?"
II,I,KING JOHN,"If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:"
II,I,KING JOHN,"For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And all that we upon this side the sea,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Except this city now by us besieged,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Find liable to our crown and dignity,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich"
II,I,KING JOHN,"In titles, honours and promotions,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"As she in beauty, education, blood,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Holds hand with any princess of the world."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face."
II,I,LEWIS,"I do, my lord; and in her eye I find"
II,I,LEWIS,"A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,"
II,I,LEWIS,"The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:"
II,I,LEWIS,"Which being but the shadow of your son,"
II,I,LEWIS,"Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:"
II,I,LEWIS,"I do protest I never loved myself"
II,I,LEWIS,"Till now infixed I beheld myself"
II,I,LEWIS,"Drawn in the flattering table of her eye."
II,I,BASTARD,"Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!"
II,I,BASTARD,"Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!"
II,I,BASTARD,"And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy"
II,I,BASTARD,"Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,"
II,I,BASTARD,"That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be"
II,I,BASTARD,"In such a love so vile a lout as he."
II,I,BLANCH,"My uncle's will in this respect is mine:"
II,I,BLANCH,"If he see aught in you that makes him like,"
II,I,BLANCH,"That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,"
II,I,BLANCH,"I can with ease translate it to my will;"
II,I,BLANCH,"Or if you will, to speak more properly,"
II,I,BLANCH,"I will enforce it easily to my love."
II,I,BLANCH,"Further I will not flatter you, my lord,"
II,I,BLANCH,"That all I see in you is worthy love,"
II,I,BLANCH,"Than this; that nothing do I see in you,"
II,I,BLANCH,"Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,"
II,I,BLANCH,"That I can find should merit any hate."
II,I,KING JOHN,"What say these young ones? What say you my niece?"
II,I,BLANCH,"That she is bound in honour still to do"
II,I,BLANCH,"What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?"
II,I,LEWIS,"Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;"
II,I,LEWIS,"For I do love her most unfeignedly."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"With her to thee; and this addition more,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Full thirty thousand marks of English coin."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Command thy son and daughter to join hands."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"It likes us well; young princes, close your hands."
II,I,AUSTRIA,"And your lips too; for I am well assured"
II,I,AUSTRIA,"That I did so when I was first assured."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Let in that amity which you have made;"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"For at Saint Mary's chapel presently"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"The rites of marriage shall be solemnized."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"I know she is not, for this match made up"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Her presence would have interrupted much:"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows."
II,I,LEWIS,"She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"And, by my faith, this league that we have made"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Will give her sadness very little cure."
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Brother of England, how may we content"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"This widow lady? In her right we came;"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,"
II,I,KING PHILIP,"To our own vantage."
II,I,KING JOHN,"We will heal up all;"
II,I,KING JOHN,"For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne"
II,I,KING JOHN,"And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town"
II,I,KING JOHN,"We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Some speedy messenger bid her repair"
II,I,KING JOHN,"To our solemnity: I trust we shall,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"If not fill up the measure of her will,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"Yet in some measure satisfy her so"
II,I,KING JOHN,"That we shall stop her exclamation."
II,I,KING JOHN,"Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,"
II,I,KING JOHN,"To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp."
II,I,BASTARD,"Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!"
II,I,BASTARD,"John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Hath willingly departed with a part,"
II,I,BASTARD,"And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Whom zeal and charity brought to the field"
II,I,BASTARD,"As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear"
II,I,BASTARD,"With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,"
II,I,BASTARD,"That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,"
II,I,BASTARD,"That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Who, having no external thing to lose"
II,I,BASTARD,"But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,"
II,I,BASTARD,"That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Commodity, the bias of the world,"
II,I,BASTARD,"The world, who of itself is peised well,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Made to run even upon even ground,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,"
II,I,BASTARD,"This sway of motion, this Commodity,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Makes it take head from all indifferency,"
II,I,BASTARD,"From all direction, purpose, course, intent:"
II,I,BASTARD,"And this same bias, this Commodity,"
II,I,BASTARD,"This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,"
II,I,BASTARD,"From a resolved and honourable war,"
II,I,BASTARD,"To a most base and vile-concluded peace."
II,I,BASTARD,"And why rail I on this Commodity?"
II,I,BASTARD,"But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:"
II,I,BASTARD,"Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,"
II,I,BASTARD,"When his fair angels would salute my palm;"
II,I,BASTARD,"But for my hand, as unattempted yet,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich."
II,I,BASTARD,"Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail"
II,I,BASTARD,"And say there is no sin but to be rich;"
II,I,BASTARD,"And being rich, my virtue then shall be"
II,I,BASTARD,"To say there is no vice but beggary."
II,I,BASTARD,"Since kings break faith upon commodity,"
II,I,BASTARD,"Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Is but the vain breath of a common man:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"I have a king's oath to the contrary."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"For I am sick and capable of fears,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"A woman, naturally born to fears;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"But they will quake and tremble all this day."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"What means that hand upon that breast of thine?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Then speak again; not all thy former tale,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"But this one word, whether thy tale be true."
III,I,SALISBURY,"As true as I believe you think them false"
III,I,SALISBURY,"That give you cause to prove my saying true."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And let belief and life encounter so"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"As doth the fury of two desperate men"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Which in the very meeting fall and die."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"France friend with England, what becomes of me?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"This news hath made thee a most ugly man."
III,I,SALISBURY,"What other harm have I, good lady, done,"
III,I,SALISBURY,"But spoke the harm that is by others done?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Which harm within itself so heinous is"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"As it makes harmful all that speak of it."
III,I,ARTHUR,"I do beseech you, madam, be content."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"I would not care, I then would be content,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And made his majesty the bawd to theirs."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Envenom him with words, or get thee gone"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And leave those woes alone which I alone"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Am bound to under-bear."
III,I,SALISBURY,"Pardon me, madam,"
III,I,SALISBURY,"I may not go without you to the kings."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"To me and to the state of my great grief"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"That no supporter but the huge firm earth"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it."
III,I,KING PHILIP,"'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Ever in France shall be kept festival:"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"To solemnize this day the glorious sun"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Turning with splendor of his precious eye"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"The yearly course that brings this day about"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Shall never see it but a holiday."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"A wicked day, and not a holy day!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"That it in golden letters should be set"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Among the high tides in the calendar?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"This day of shame, oppression, perjury."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"No bargains break that are not this day made:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"This day, all things begun come to ill end,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"To curse the fair proceedings of this day:"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"You have beguiled me with a counterfeit"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"The grappling vigour and rough frown of war"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Is cold in amity and painted peace,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And our oppression hath made up this league."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Let not the hours of this ungodly day"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Hear me, O, hear me!"
III,I,AUSTRIA,"Lady Constance, peace!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Thou little valiant, great in villany!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"But when her humorous ladyship is by"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And dost thou now fall over to my fores?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs."
III,I,AUSTRIA,"O, that a man should speak those words to me!"
III,I,BASTARD,"And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs."
III,I,AUSTRIA,"Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life."
III,I,BASTARD,"And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs."
III,I,KING JOHN,"We like not this; thou dost forget thyself."
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Here comes the holy legate of the pope."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"To thee, King John, my holy errand is."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And from Pope Innocent the legate here,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Do in his name religiously demand"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Why thou against the church, our holy mother,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Of Canterbury, from that holy see?"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"This, in our foresaid holy father's name,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee."
III,I,KING JOHN,"What earthy name to interrogatories"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Can task the free breath of a sacred king?"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name"
III,I,KING JOHN,"So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"To charge me to an answer, as the pope."
III,I,KING JOHN,"Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Add thus much more, that no Italian priest"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;"
III,I,KING JOHN,"But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"So under Him that great supremacy,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Without the assistance of a mortal hand:"
III,I,KING JOHN,"So tell the pope, all reverence set apart"
III,I,KING JOHN,"To him and his usurp'd authority."
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Brother of England, you blaspheme in this."
III,I,KING JOHN,"Though you and all the kings of Christendom"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Dreading the curse that money may buy out;"
III,I,KING JOHN,"And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Though you and all the rest so grossly led"
III,I,KING JOHN,"This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Yet I alone, alone do me oppose"
III,I,KING JOHN,"Against the pope and count his friends my foes."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Then, by the lawful power that I have,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And blessed shall he be that doth revolt"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"From his allegiance to an heretic;"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Canonized and worshipped as a saint,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That takes away by any secret course"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Thy hateful life."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O, lawful let it be"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Good father cardinal, cry thou amen"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"To my keen curses; for without my wrong"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"There is no tongue hath power to curse him right."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And for mine too: when law can do no right,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Philip of France, on peril of a curse,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And raise the power of France upon his head,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Unless he do submit himself to Rome."
III,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul."
III,I,AUSTRIA,"King Philip, listen to the cardinal."
III,I,BASTARD,"And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs."
III,I,AUSTRIA,"Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--"
III,I,BASTARD,"Your breeches best may carry them."
III,I,KING JOHN,"Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"What should he say, but as the cardinal?"
III,I,LEWIS,"Bethink you, father; for the difference"
III,I,LEWIS,"Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,"
III,I,LEWIS,"Or the light loss of England for a friend:"
III,I,LEWIS,"Forego the easier."
III,I,BLANCH,"That's the curse of Rome."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"In likeness of a new untrimmed bride."
III,I,BLANCH,"The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,"
III,I,BLANCH,"But from her need."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O, if thou grant my need,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Which only lives but by the death of faith,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"That need must needs infer this principle,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"That faith would live again by death of need."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!"
III,I,KING JOHN,"The king is moved, and answers not to this."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O, be removed from him, and answer well!"
III,I,AUSTRIA,"Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt."
III,I,BASTARD,"Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout."
III,I,KING PHILIP,"I am perplex'd, and know not what to say."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Good reverend father, make my person yours,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"And tell me how you would bestow yourself."
III,I,KING PHILIP,"This royal hand and mine are newly knit,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"And the conjunction of our inward souls"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Married in league, coupled and linked together"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"With all religious strength of sacred vows;"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"The latest breath that gave the sound of words"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"And even before this truce, but new before,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"No longer than we well could wash our hands"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"To clap this royal bargain up of peace,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"The fearful difference of incensed kings:"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Make such unconstant children of ourselves,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"As now again to snatch our palm from palm,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"And make a riot on the gentle brow"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"My reverend father, let it not be so!"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"To do your pleasure and continue friends."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"All form is formless, order orderless,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Save what is opposite to England's love."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"A mother's curse, on her revolting son."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"A chafed lion by the mortal paw,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold."
III,I,KING PHILIP,"I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That is, to be the champion of our church!"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And may not be performed by thyself,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Is not amiss when it is truly done,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And being not done, where doing tends to ill,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The truth is then most done not doing it:"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The better act of purposes mistook"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Is to mistake again; though indirect,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Yet indirection thereby grows direct,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"It is religion that doth make vows kept;"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"But thou hast sworn against religion,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And makest an oath the surety for thy truth"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Else what a mockery should it be to swear!"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Therefore thy later vows against thy first"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And better conquest never canst thou make"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Against these giddy loose suggestions:"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Upon which better part our prayers come in,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The peril of our curses light on thee"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,"
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"But in despair die under their black weight."
III,I,AUSTRIA,"Rebellion, flat rebellion!"
III,I,BASTARD,"Will't not be?"
III,I,BASTARD,"Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?"
III,I,LEWIS,"Father, to arms!"
III,I,BLANCH,"Upon thy wedding-day?"
III,I,BLANCH,"Against the blood that thou hast married?"
III,I,BLANCH,"What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?"
III,I,BLANCH,"Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,"
III,I,BLANCH,"Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?"
III,I,BLANCH,"O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new"
III,I,BLANCH,"Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,"
III,I,BLANCH,"Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,"
III,I,BLANCH,"Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms"
III,I,BLANCH,"Against mine uncle."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O, upon my knee,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"Forethought by heaven!"
III,I,BLANCH,"Now shall I see thy love: what motive may"
III,I,BLANCH,"Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,"
III,I,CONSTANCE,"His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!"
III,I,LEWIS,"I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,"
III,I,LEWIS,"When such profound respects do pull you on."
III,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"I will denounce a curse upon his head."
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee."
III,I,CONSTANCE,"O fair return of banish'd majesty!"
III,I,QUEEN ELINOR,"O foul revolt of French inconstancy!"
III,I,KING JOHN,"France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour."
III,I,BASTARD,"Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,"
III,I,BASTARD,"Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue."
III,I,BLANCH,"The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!"
III,I,BLANCH,"Which is the side that I must go withal?"
III,I,BLANCH,"I am with both: each army hath a hand;"
III,I,BLANCH,"And in their rage, I having hold of both,"
III,I,BLANCH,"They swirl asunder and dismember me."
III,I,BLANCH,"Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;"
III,I,BLANCH,"Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;"
III,I,BLANCH,"Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;"
III,I,BLANCH,"Grandam, I will not wish thy fortunes thrive:"
III,I,BLANCH,"Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose"
III,I,BLANCH,"Assured loss before the match be play'd."
III,I,LEWIS,"Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies."
III,I,BLANCH,"There where my fortune lives, there my life dies."
III,I,KING JOHN,"Cousin, go draw our puissance together."
III,I,KING JOHN,"France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;"
III,I,KING JOHN,"A rage whose heat hath this condition,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,"
III,I,KING JOHN,"The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France."
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:"
III,I,KING PHILIP,"Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy."
III,I,KING JOHN,"No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!"
III,II,BASTARD,"Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;"
III,II,BASTARD,"Some airy devil hovers in the sky"
III,II,BASTARD,"And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,"
III,II,BASTARD,"While Philip breathes."
III,II,KING JOHN,"Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:"
III,II,KING JOHN,"My mother is assailed in our tent,"
III,II,KING JOHN,"And ta'en, I fear."
III,II,BASTARD,"My lord, I rescued her;"
III,II,BASTARD,"Her highness is in safety, fear you not:"
III,II,BASTARD,"But on, my liege; for very little pains"
III,II,BASTARD,"Will bring this labour to an happy end."
III,III,KING JOHN,"stay behind"
III,III,KING JOHN,"So strongly guarded."
III,III,KING JOHN,"Cousin, look not sad:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will"
III,III,KING JOHN,"As dear be to thee as thy father was."
III,III,ARTHUR,"O, this will make my mother die with grief!"
III,III,KING JOHN,"haste before:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Must by the hungry now be fed upon:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Use our commission in his utmost force."
III,III,BASTARD,"Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,"
III,III,BASTARD,"When gold and silver becks me to come on."
III,III,BASTARD,"I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,"
III,III,BASTARD,"If ever I remember to be holy,"
III,III,BASTARD,"For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand."
III,III,ELINOR,"Farewell, gentle cousin."
III,III,KING JOHN,"Coz, farewell."
III,III,QUEEN ELINOR,"Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word."
III,III,KING JOHN,"Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh"
III,III,KING JOHN,"There is a soul counts thee her creditor"
III,III,KING JOHN,"And with advantage means to pay thy love:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"And my good friend, thy voluntary oath"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished."
III,III,KING JOHN,"Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"But I will fit it with some better time."
III,III,KING JOHN,"By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed"
III,III,KING JOHN,"To say what good respect I have of thee."
III,III,HUBERT,"I am much bounden to your majesty."
III,III,KING JOHN,"Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Yet it shall come from me to do thee good."
III,III,KING JOHN,"I had a thing to say, but let it go:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Attended with the pleasures of the world,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Is all too wanton and too full of gawds"
III,III,KING JOHN,"To give me audience: if the midnight bell"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Sound on into the drowsy race of night;"
III,III,KING JOHN,"If this same were a churchyard where we stand,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes"
III,III,KING JOHN,"And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"A passion hateful to my purposes,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Hear me without thine ears, and make reply"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Without a tongue, using conceit alone,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;"
III,III,KING JOHN,"And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well."
III,III,HUBERT,"So well, that what you bid me undertake,"
III,III,HUBERT,"Though that my death were adjunct to my act,"
III,III,HUBERT,"By heaven, I would do it."
III,III,KING JOHN,"Do not I know thou wouldst?"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye"
III,III,KING JOHN,"On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"He is a very serpent in my way;"
III,III,KING JOHN,"And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,"
III,III,KING JOHN,"He lies before me: dost thou understand me?"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Thou art his keeper."
III,III,HUBERT,"And I'll keep him so,"
III,III,HUBERT,"That he shall not offend your majesty."
III,III,KING JOHN,"Death."
III,III,HUBERT,"My lord?"
III,III,KING JOHN,"A grave."
III,III,HUBERT,"He shall not live."
III,III,KING JOHN,"Enough."
III,III,KING JOHN,"I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Remember. Madam, fare you well:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty."
III,III,ELINOR,"My blessing go with thee!"
III,III,KING JOHN,"For England, cousin, go:"
III,III,KING JOHN,"Hubert shall be your man, attend on you"
III,III,KING JOHN,"With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"A whole armado of convicted sail"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well."
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"What can go well, when we have run so ill?"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"And bloody England into England gone,"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?"
III,IV,LEWIS,"What he hath won, that hath he fortified:"
III,IV,LEWIS,"So hot a speed with such advice disposed,"
III,IV,LEWIS,"Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,"
III,IV,LEWIS,"Doth want example: who hath read or heard"
III,IV,LEWIS,"Of any kindred action like to this?"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Well could I bear that England had this praise,"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"So we could find some pattern of our shame."
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Holding the eternal spirit against her will,"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"In the vile prison of afflicted breath."
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"I prithee, lady, go away with me."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace."
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"No, I defy all counsel, all redress,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"But that which ends all counsel, true redress,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Death, death; O amiable lovely death!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Thou hate and terror to prosperity,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And I will kiss thy detestable bones"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And ring these fingers with thy household worms"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And be a carrion monster like thyself:"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"O, come to me!"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"O fair affliction, peace!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Then with a passion would I shake the world;"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Which scorns a modern invocation."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Thou art not holy to belie me so;"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"O, if I could, what grief should I forget!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Preach some philosophy to make me mad,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"For being not mad but sensible of grief,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"My reasonable part produces reason"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"How I may be deliver'd of these woes,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And teaches me to kill or hang myself:"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"If I were mad, I should forget my son,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"I am not mad; too well, too well I feel"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"The different plague of each calamity."
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"In the fair multitude of those her hairs!"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Do glue themselves in sociable grief,"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Sticking together in calamity."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"To England, if you will."
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"Bind up your hairs."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"'O that these hands could so redeem my son,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"As they have given these hairs their liberty!'"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"But now I envy at their liberty,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And will again commit them to their bonds,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Because my poor child is a prisoner."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And, father cardinal, I have heard you say"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"If that be true, I shall see my boy again;"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"To him that did but yesterday suspire,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"There was not such a gracious creature born."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And chase the native beauty from his cheek"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And he will look as hollow as a ghost,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"And so he'll die; and, rising so again,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"When I shall meet him in the court of heaven"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"I shall not know him: therefore never, never"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Must I behold my pretty Arthur more."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"You hold too heinous a respect of grief."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"He talks to me that never had a son."
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"You are as fond of grief as of your child."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Grief fills the room up of my absent child,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Remembers me of all his gracious parts,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"I could give better comfort than you do."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"I will not keep this form upon my head,"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"When there is such disorder in my wit."
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!"
III,IV,CONSTANCE,"My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!"
III,IV,KING PHILIP,"I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her."
III,IV,LEWIS,"There's nothing in this world can make me joy:"
III,IV,LEWIS,"Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale"
III,IV,LEWIS,"Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;"
III,IV,LEWIS,"And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste"
III,IV,LEWIS,"That it yields nought but shame and bitterness."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Before the curing of a strong disease,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Even in the instant of repair and health,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"On their departure most of all show evil:"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"What have you lost by losing of this day?"
III,IV,LEWIS,"All days of glory, joy and happiness."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"If you had won it, certainly you had."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"She looks upon them with a threatening eye."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"In this which he accounts so clearly won:"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?"
III,IV,LEWIS,"As heartily as he is glad he hath him."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Your mind is all as youthful as your blood."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"For even the breath of what I mean to speak"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Out of the path which shall directly lead"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The misplaced John should entertain an hour,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And he that stands upon a slippery place"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"So be it, for it cannot be but so."
III,IV,LEWIS,"But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"May then make all the claim that Arthur did."
III,IV,LEWIS,"And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"How green you are and fresh in this old world!"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"For he that steeps his safety in true blood"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Shall find but bloody safety and untrue."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That none so small advantage shall step forth"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"No natural exhalation in the sky,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"No common wind, no customed event,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"But they will pluck away his natural cause"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John."
III,IV,LEWIS,"May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,"
III,IV,LEWIS,"But hold himself safe in his prisonment."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"If that young Arthur be not gone already,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Of all his people shall revolt from him"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And kiss the lips of unacquainted change"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And, O, what better matter breeds for you"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Is now in England, ransacking the church,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Offending charity: if but a dozen French"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Were there in arms, they would be as a call"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"To train ten thousand English to their side,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Or as a little snow, tumbled about,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"What may be wrought out of their discontent,"
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Now that their souls are topful of offence."
III,IV,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"For England go: I will whet on the king."
III,IV,LEWIS,"Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:"
III,IV,LEWIS,"If you say ay, the king will not say no."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Within the arras: when I strike my foot"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,"
IV,I,HUBERT,"And bind the boy which you shall find with me"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch."
IV,I,First Executioner,"I hope your warrant will bear out the deed."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Good morrow, Hubert."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Good morrow, little prince."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"As little prince, having so great a title"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"To be more prince, as may be. You are sad."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Indeed, I have been merrier."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Mercy on me!"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Methinks no body should be sad but I:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Yet, I remember, when I was in France,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Only for wantonness. By my christendom,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"So I were out of prison and kept sheep,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"I should be as merry as the day is long;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And so I would be here, but that I doubt"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"My uncle practises more harm to me:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"He is afraid of me and I of him:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert."
IV,I,HUBERT,"He will awake my mercy which lies dead:"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"In sooth, I would you were a little sick,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"That I might sit all night and watch with you:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"I warrant I love you more than you do me."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Read here, young Arthur."
IV,I,HUBERT,"How now, foolish rheum!"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Turning dispiteous torture out of door!"
IV,I,HUBERT,"I must be brief, lest resolution drop"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Young boy, I must."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And will you?"
IV,I,HUBERT,"And I will."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"I knit my handercher about your brows,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"The best I had, a princess wrought it me,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And I did never ask it you again;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And with my hand at midnight held your head,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And like the watchful minutes to the hour,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Many a poor man's son would have lien still"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"But you at your sick service had a prince."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Nay, you may think my love was crafty love"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And call it cunning: do, an if you will:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"These eyes that never did nor never shall"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"So much as frown on you."
IV,I,HUBERT,"I have sworn to do it;"
IV,I,HUBERT,"And with hot irons must I burn them out."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And quench his fiery indignation"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Even in the matter of mine innocence;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Nay, after that, consume away in rust"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"But for containing fire to harm mine eye."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"An if an angel should have come to me"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Come forth."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Do as I bid you do."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Nor look upon the iron angerly:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Whatever torment you do put me to."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Go, stand within; let me alone with him."
IV,I,First Executioner,"I am best pleased to be from such a deed."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Alas, I then have chid away my friend!"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Let him come back, that his compassion may"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Give life to yours."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Come, boy, prepare yourself."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Is there no remedy?"
IV,I,HUBERT,"None, but to lose your eyes."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Any annoyance in that precious sense!"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Your vile intent must needs seem horrible."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Though to no use but still to look on you!"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And would not harm me."
IV,I,HUBERT,"I can heat it, boy."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Being create for comfort, to be used"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"There is no malice in this burning coal;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And strew'd repentent ashes on his head."
IV,I,HUBERT,"But with my breath I can revive it, boy."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"An if you do, you will but make it blush"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"All things that you should use to do me wrong"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Deny their office: only you do lack"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye"
IV,I,HUBERT,"For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,"
IV,I,HUBERT,"With this same very iron to burn them out."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"O, now you look like Hubert! all this while"
IV,I,ARTHUR,"You were disguised."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Peace; no more. Adieu."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Your uncle must not know but you are dead;"
IV,I,HUBERT,"I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:"
IV,I,HUBERT,"And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,"
IV,I,HUBERT,"That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Will not offend thee."
IV,I,ARTHUR,"O heaven! I thank you, Hubert."
IV,I,HUBERT,"Silence; no more: go closely in with me:"
IV,I,HUBERT,"Much danger do I undergo for thee."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes."
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Fresh expectation troubled not the land"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"With any long'd-for change or better state."
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"To guard a title that was rich before,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"To throw a perfume on the violet,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"To smooth the ice, or add another hue"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Is wasteful and ridiculous excess."
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"But that your royal pleasure must be done,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"This act is as an ancient tale new told,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"And in the last repeating troublesome,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Being urged at a time unseasonable."
IV,II,SALISBURY,"In this the antique and well noted face"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Of plain old form is much disfigured;"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Startles and frights consideration,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"For putting on so new a fashion'd robe."
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"When workmen strive to do better than well,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"They do confound their skill in covetousness;"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"And oftentimes excusing of a fault"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"As patches set upon a little breach"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Discredit more in hiding of the fault"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Than did the fault before it was so patch'd."
IV,II,SALISBURY,"To this effect, before you were new crown'd,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Since all and every part of what we would"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Doth make a stand at what your highness will."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Some reasons of this double coronation"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"I have possess'd you with and think them strong;"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"I shall indue you with: meantime but ask"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"What you would have reform'd that is not well,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And well shall you perceive how willingly"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"I will both hear and grant you your requests."
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"To sound the purpose of all their hearts,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Your safety, for the which myself and them"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Bend their best studies, heartily request"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"To break into this dangerous argument,--"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"If what in rest you have in right you hold,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Your tender kinsman and to choke his days"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"The rich advantage of good exercise?"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"That the time's enemies may not have this"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"To grace occasions, let it be our suit"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"That you have bid us ask his liberty;"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Which for our goods we do no further ask"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Counts it your weal he have his liberty."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Let it be so: I do commit his youth"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"This is the man should do the bloody deed;"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"The image of a wicked heinous fault"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"What we so fear'd he had a charge to do."
IV,II,SALISBURY,"The colour of the king doth come and go"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Between his purpose and his conscience,"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"His passion is so ripe, it needs must break."
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"The foul corruption of a sweet child's death."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Good lords, although my will to give is living,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"The suit which you demand is gone and dead:"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night."
IV,II,SALISBURY,"Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure."
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Indeed we heard how near his death he was"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Before the child himself felt he was sick:"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"This must be answer'd either here or hence."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Think you I bear the shears of destiny?"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Have I commandment on the pulse of life?"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"That greatness should so grossly offer it:"
IV,II,SALISBURY,"So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell."
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"And find the inheritance of this poor child,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"His little kingdom of a forced grave."
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"This must not be thus borne: this will break out"
IV,II,PEMBROKE,"To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"They burn in indignation. I repent:"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"There is no sure foundation set on blood,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"No certain life achieved by others' death."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"So foul a sky clears not without a storm:"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?"
IV,II,Messenger,"From France to England. Never such a power"
IV,II,Messenger,"For any foreign preparation"
IV,II,Messenger,"Was levied in the body of a land."
IV,II,Messenger,"The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;"
IV,II,Messenger,"For when you should be told they do prepare,"
IV,II,Messenger,"The tidings come that they are all arrived."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"That such an army could be drawn in France,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And she not hear of it?"
IV,II,Messenger,"My liege, her ear"
IV,II,Messenger,"Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died"
IV,II,Messenger,"Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,"
IV,II,Messenger,"The Lady Constance in a frenzy died"
IV,II,Messenger,"Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue"
IV,II,Messenger,"I idly heard; if true or false I know not."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"O, make a league with me, till I have pleased"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"My discontented peers! What! mother dead!"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"How wildly then walks my estate in France!"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Under whose conduct came those powers of France"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"That thou for truth givest out are landed here?"
IV,II,Messenger,"Under the Dauphin."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Thou hast made me giddy"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"With these ill tidings."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Now, what says the world"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"My head with more ill news, for it is full."
IV,II,BASTARD,"But if you be afeard to hear the worst,"
IV,II,BASTARD,"Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Under the tide: but now I breathe again"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Aloft the flood, and can give audience"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"To any tongue, speak it of what it will."
IV,II,BASTARD,"How I have sped among the clergymen,"
IV,II,BASTARD,"The sums I have collected shall express."
IV,II,BASTARD,"But as I travell'd hither through the land,"
IV,II,BASTARD,"I find the people strangely fantasied;"
IV,II,BASTARD,"Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,"
IV,II,BASTARD,"Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:"
IV,II,BASTARD,"And here a prophet, that I brought with me"
IV,II,BASTARD,"From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found"
IV,II,BASTARD,"With many hundreds treading on his heels;"
IV,II,BASTARD,"To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,"
IV,II,BASTARD,"That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,"
IV,II,BASTARD,"Your highness should deliver up your crown."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?"
IV,II,PETER,"Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Hubert, away with him; imprison him;"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And on that day at noon whereon he says"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Deliver him to safety; and return,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"For I must use thee."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"O my gentle cousin,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?"
IV,II,BASTARD,"The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:"
IV,II,BASTARD,"Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,"
IV,II,BASTARD,"With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,"
IV,II,BASTARD,"And others more, going to seek the grave"
IV,II,BASTARD,"Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night"
IV,II,BASTARD,"On your suggestion."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Gentle kinsman, go,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And thrust thyself into their companies:"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"I have a way to win their loves again;"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Bring them before me."
IV,II,BASTARD,"I will seek them out."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Nay, but make haste; the better foot before."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"O, let me have no subject enemies,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"When adverse foreigners affright my towns"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And fly like thought from them to me again."
IV,II,BASTARD,"The spirit of the time shall teach me speed."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Go after him; for he perhaps shall need"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And be thou he."
IV,II,Messenger,"With all my heart, my liege."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"My mother dead!"
IV,II,HUBERT,"My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about"
IV,II,HUBERT,"The other four in wondrous motion."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Five moons!"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Old men and beldams in the streets"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Do prophesy upon it dangerously:"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:"
IV,II,HUBERT,"And when they talk of him, they shake their heads"
IV,II,HUBERT,"And whisper one another in the ear;"
IV,II,HUBERT,"And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes."
IV,II,HUBERT,"I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Told of a many thousand warlike French"
IV,II,HUBERT,"That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Another lean unwash'd artificer"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him."
IV,II,HUBERT,"No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"It is the curse of kings to be attended"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"By slaves that take their humours for a warrant"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"To break within the bloody house of life,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And on the winking of authority"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"To understand a law, to know the meaning"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"More upon humour than advised respect."
IV,II,HUBERT,"Here is your hand and seal for what I did."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Witness against us to damnation!"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"This murder had not come into my mind:"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Finding thee fit for bloody villany,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And thou, to be endeared to a king,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Made it no conscience to destroy a prince."
IV,II,HUBERT,"My lord--"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"When I spake darkly what I purposed,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"As bid me tell my tale in express words,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"But thou didst understand me by my signs"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And didst in signs again parley with sin;"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And consequently thy rude hand to act"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Out of my sight, and never see me more!"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Hostility and civil tumult reigns"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Between my conscience and my cousin's death."
IV,II,HUBERT,"Arm you against your other enemies,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"I'll make a peace between your soul and you."
IV,II,HUBERT,"Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Not painted with the crimson spots of blood."
IV,II,HUBERT,"Within this bosom never enter'd yet"
IV,II,HUBERT,"The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;"
IV,II,HUBERT,"And you have slander'd nature in my form,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Is yet the cover of a fairer mind"
IV,II,HUBERT,"Than to be butcher of an innocent child."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Throw this report on their incensed rage,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And make them tame to their obedience!"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Forgive the comment that my passion made"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"And foul imaginary eyes of blood"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"Presented thee more hideous than thou art."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"O, answer not, but to my closet bring"
IV,II,KING JOHN,"The angry lords with all expedient haste."
IV,II,KING JOHN,"I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast."
IV,III,ARTHUR,"The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:"
IV,III,ARTHUR,"Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!"
IV,III,ARTHUR,"There's few or none do know me: if they did,"
IV,III,ARTHUR,"This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite."
IV,III,ARTHUR,"I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it."
IV,III,ARTHUR,"If I get down, and do not break my limbs,"
IV,III,ARTHUR,"I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:"
IV,III,ARTHUR,"As good to die and go, as die and stay."
IV,III,ARTHUR,"O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:"
IV,III,ARTHUR,"Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"It is our safety, and we must embrace"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"This gentle offer of the perilous time."
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"Who brought that letter from the cardinal?"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Is much more general than these lines import."
IV,III,BIGOT,"To-morrow morning let us meet him then."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!"
IV,III,BASTARD,"The king by me requests your presence straight."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"We will not line his thin bestained cloak"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"With our pure honours, nor attend the foot"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Return and tell him so: we know the worst."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now."
IV,III,BASTARD,"But there is little reason in your grief;"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now."
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege."
IV,III,BASTARD,"'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"This is the prison. What is he lies here?"
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!"
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"The earth had not a hole to hide this deed."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Murder, as hating what himself hath done,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Doth lay it open to urge on revenge."
IV,III,BIGOT,"Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,"
IV,III,BIGOT,"Found it too precious-princely for a grave."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Or have you read or heard? or could you think?"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Or do you almost think, although you see,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"That you do see? could thought, without this object,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Form such another? This is the very top,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Presented to the tears of soft remorse."
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"All murders past do stand excused in this:"
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"And this, so sole and so unmatchable,"
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"Shall give a holiness, a purity,"
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"To the yet unbegotten sin of times;"
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,"
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"Exampled by this heinous spectacle."
IV,III,BASTARD,"It is a damned and a bloody work;"
IV,III,BASTARD,"The graceless action of a heavy hand,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"If that it be the work of any hand."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"If that it be the work of any hand!"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"We had a kind of light what would ensue:"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"The practise and the purpose of the king:"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"From whose obedience I forbid my soul,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"And breathing to his breathless excellence"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"The incense of a vow, a holy vow,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Never to taste the pleasures of the world,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Never to be infected with delight,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Nor conversant with ease and idleness,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Till I have set a glory to this hand,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"By giving it the worship of revenge."
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"Our souls religiously confirm thy words."
IV,III,HUBERT,"Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"O, he is old and blushes not at death."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!"
IV,III,HUBERT,"I am no villain."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Must I rob the law?"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin."
IV,III,HUBERT,"Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;"
IV,III,HUBERT,"By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:"
IV,III,HUBERT,"I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Your worth, your greatness and nobility."
IV,III,BIGOT,"Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Not for my life: but yet I dare defend"
IV,III,HUBERT,"My innocent life against an emperor."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Thou art a murderer."
IV,III,HUBERT,"Do not prove me so;"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies."
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"Cut him to pieces."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Keep the peace, I say."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:"
IV,III,BASTARD,"If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"That you shall think the devil is come from hell."
IV,III,BIGOT,"What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?"
IV,III,BIGOT,"Second a villain and a murderer?"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Lord Bigot, I am none."
IV,III,BIGOT,"Who kill'd this prince?"
IV,III,HUBERT,"'Tis not an hour since I left him well:"
IV,III,HUBERT,"I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep"
IV,III,HUBERT,"My date of life out for his sweet life's loss."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"For villany is not without such rheum;"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"And he, long traded in it, makes it seem"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Like rivers of remorse and innocency."
IV,III,SALISBURY,"Away with me, all you whose souls abhor"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;"
IV,III,SALISBURY,"For I am stifled with this smell of sin."
IV,III,BIGOT,"Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!"
IV,III,PEMBROKE,"There tell the king he may inquire us out."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Beyond the infinite and boundless reach"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Art thou damn'd, Hubert."
IV,III,HUBERT,"Do but hear me, sir."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Ha! I'll tell thee what;"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:"
IV,III,BASTARD,"There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell"
IV,III,BASTARD,"As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child."
IV,III,HUBERT,"Upon my soul--"
IV,III,BASTARD,"If thou didst but consent"
IV,III,BASTARD,"To this most cruel act, do but despair;"
IV,III,BASTARD,"And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread"
IV,III,BASTARD,"That ever spider twisted from her womb"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam"
IV,III,BASTARD,"To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Put but a little water in a spoon,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"And it shall be as all the ocean,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Enough to stifle such a villain up."
IV,III,BASTARD,"I do suspect thee very grievously."
IV,III,HUBERT,"If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,"
IV,III,HUBERT,"Let hell want pains enough to torture me."
IV,III,HUBERT,"I left him well."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Go, bear him in thine arms."
IV,III,BASTARD,"I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Among the thorns and dangers of this world."
IV,III,BASTARD,"How easy dost thou take all England up!"
IV,III,BASTARD,"From forth this morsel of dead royalty,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"The life, the right and truth of all this realm"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Is fled to heaven; and England now is left"
IV,III,BASTARD,"To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth"
IV,III,BASTARD,"The unowed interest of proud-swelling state."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest"
IV,III,BASTARD,"And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Now powers from home and discontents at home"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"The imminent decay of wrested pomp."
IV,III,BASTARD,"Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can"
IV,III,BASTARD,"Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child"
IV,III,BASTARD,"And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:"
IV,III,BASTARD,"A thousand businesses are brief in hand,"
IV,III,BASTARD,"And heaven itself doth frown upon the land."
V,I,KING JOHN,"Thus have I yielded up into your hand"
V,I,KING JOHN,"The circle of my glory."
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Take again"
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"From this my hand, as holding of the pope"
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Your sovereign greatness and authority."
V,I,KING JOHN,"Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,"
V,I,KING JOHN,"And from his holiness use all your power"
V,I,KING JOHN,"To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed."
V,I,KING JOHN,"Our discontented counties do revolt;"
V,I,KING JOHN,"Our people quarrel with obedience,"
V,I,KING JOHN,"Swearing allegiance and the love of soul"
V,I,KING JOHN,"To stranger blood, to foreign royalty."
V,I,KING JOHN,"This inundation of mistemper'd humour"
V,I,KING JOHN,"Rests by you only to be qualified:"
V,I,KING JOHN,"Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,"
V,I,KING JOHN,"That present medicine must be minister'd,"
V,I,KING JOHN,"Or overthrow incurable ensues."
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"It was my breath that blew this tempest up,"
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;"
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"But since you are a gentle convertite,"
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"My tongue shall hush again this storm of war"
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And make fair weather in your blustering land."
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"On this Ascension-day, remember well,"
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Upon your oath of service to the pope,"
V,I,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Go I to make the French lay down their arms."
V,I,KING JOHN,"Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet"
V,I,KING JOHN,"Say that before Ascension-day at noon"
V,I,KING JOHN,"My crown I should give off? Even so I have:"
V,I,KING JOHN,"I did suppose it should be on constraint:"
V,I,KING JOHN,"But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary."
V,I,BASTARD,"All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out"
V,I,BASTARD,"But Dover castle: London hath received,"
V,I,BASTARD,"Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:"
V,I,BASTARD,"Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone"
V,I,BASTARD,"To offer service to your enemy,"
V,I,BASTARD,"And wild amazement hurries up and down"
V,I,BASTARD,"The little number of your doubtful friends."
V,I,KING JOHN,"Would not my lords return to me again,"
V,I,KING JOHN,"After they heard young Arthur was alive?"
V,I,BASTARD,"They found him dead and cast into the streets,"
V,I,BASTARD,"An empty casket, where the jewel of life"
V,I,BASTARD,"By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away."
V,I,KING JOHN,"That villain Hubert told me he did live."
V,I,BASTARD,"So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew."
V,I,BASTARD,"But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?"
V,I,BASTARD,"Be great in act, as you have been in thought;"
V,I,BASTARD,"Let not the world see fear and sad distrust"
V,I,BASTARD,"Govern the motion of a kingly eye:"
V,I,BASTARD,"Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;"
V,I,BASTARD,"Threaten the threatener and outface the brow"
V,I,BASTARD,"Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,"
V,I,BASTARD,"That borrow their behaviors from the great,"
V,I,BASTARD,"Grow great by your example and put on"
V,I,BASTARD,"The dauntless spirit of resolution."
V,I,BASTARD,"Away, and glister like the god of war,"
V,I,BASTARD,"When he intendeth to become the field:"
V,I,BASTARD,"Show boldness and aspiring confidence."
V,I,BASTARD,"What, shall they seek the lion in his den,"
V,I,BASTARD,"And fright him there? and make him tremble there?"
V,I,BASTARD,"O, let it not be said: forage, and run"
V,I,BASTARD,"To meet displeasure farther from the doors,"
V,I,BASTARD,"And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh."
V,I,KING JOHN,"The legate of the pope hath been with me,"
V,I,KING JOHN,"And I have made a happy peace with him;"
V,I,KING JOHN,"And he hath promised to dismiss the powers"
V,I,KING JOHN,"Led by the Dauphin."
V,I,BASTARD,"O inglorious league!"
V,I,BASTARD,"Shall we, upon the footing of our land,"
V,I,BASTARD,"Send fair-play orders and make compromise,"
V,I,BASTARD,"Insinuation, parley and base truce"
V,I,BASTARD,"To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,"
V,I,BASTARD,"A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,"
V,I,BASTARD,"And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,"
V,I,BASTARD,"Mocking the air with colours idly spread,"
V,I,BASTARD,"And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:"
V,I,BASTARD,"Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;"
V,I,BASTARD,"Or if he do, let it at least be said"
V,I,BASTARD,"They saw we had a purpose of defence."
V,I,KING JOHN,"Have thou the ordering of this present time."
V,I,BASTARD,"Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,"
V,I,BASTARD,"Our party may well meet a prouder foe."
V,II,LEWIS,"My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,"
V,II,LEWIS,"And keep it safe for our remembrance:"
V,II,LEWIS,"Return the precedent to these lords again;"
V,II,LEWIS,"That, having our fair order written down,"
V,II,LEWIS,"Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,"
V,II,LEWIS,"May know wherefore we took the sacrament"
V,II,LEWIS,"And keep our faiths firm and inviolable."
V,II,SALISBURY,"Upon our sides it never shall be broken."
V,II,SALISBURY,"And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear"
V,II,SALISBURY,"A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith"
V,II,SALISBURY,"To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"I am not glad that such a sore of time"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"And heal the inveterate canker of one wound"
V,II,SALISBURY,"By making many. O, it grieves my soul,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"That I must draw this metal from my side"
V,II,SALISBURY,"To be a widow-maker! O, and there"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Where honourable rescue and defence"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!"
V,II,SALISBURY,"But such is the infection of the time,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"That, for the health and physic of our right,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"We cannot deal but with the very hand"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Of stern injustice and confused wrong."
V,II,SALISBURY,"And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"That we, the sons and children of this isle,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Were born to see so sad an hour as this;"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Wherein we step after a stranger march"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--"
V,II,SALISBURY,"To grace the gentry of a land remote,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"And follow unacquainted colours here?"
V,II,SALISBURY,"What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!"
V,II,SALISBURY,"That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;"
V,II,SALISBURY,"Where these two Christian armies might combine"
V,II,SALISBURY,"The blood of malice in a vein of league,"
V,II,SALISBURY,"And not to spend it so unneighbourly!"
V,II,LEWIS,"A noble temper dost thou show in this;"
V,II,LEWIS,"And great affections wrestling in thy bosom"
V,II,LEWIS,"Doth make an earthquake of nobility."
V,II,LEWIS,"O, what a noble combat hast thou fought"
V,II,LEWIS,"Between compulsion and a brave respect!"
V,II,LEWIS,"Let me wipe off this honourable dew,"
V,II,LEWIS,"That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:"
V,II,LEWIS,"My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,"
V,II,LEWIS,"Being an ordinary inundation;"
V,II,LEWIS,"But this effusion of such manly drops,"
V,II,LEWIS,"This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,"
V,II,LEWIS,"Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed"
V,II,LEWIS,"Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven"
V,II,LEWIS,"Figured quite o'er with burning meteors."
V,II,LEWIS,"Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,"
V,II,LEWIS,"And with a great heart heave away the storm:"
V,II,LEWIS,"Commend these waters to those baby eyes"
V,II,LEWIS,"That never saw the giant world enraged;"
V,II,LEWIS,"Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,"
V,II,LEWIS,"Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping."
V,II,LEWIS,"Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep"
V,II,LEWIS,"Into the purse of rich prosperity"
V,II,LEWIS,"As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,"
V,II,LEWIS,"That knit your sinews to the strength of mine."
V,II,LEWIS,"And even there, methinks, an angel spake:"
V,II,LEWIS,"Look, where the holy legate comes apace,"
V,II,LEWIS,"To give us warrant from the hand of heaven"
V,II,LEWIS,"And on our actions set the name of right"
V,II,LEWIS,"With holy breath."
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Hail, noble prince of France!"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The next is this, King John hath reconciled"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That so stood out against the holy church,"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The great metropolis and see of Rome:"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And tame the savage spirit of wild war,"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That like a lion foster'd up at hand,"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"It may lie gently at the foot of peace,"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And be no further harmful than in show."
V,II,LEWIS,"Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:"
V,II,LEWIS,"I am too high-born to be propertied,"
V,II,LEWIS,"To be a secondary at control,"
V,II,LEWIS,"Or useful serving-man and instrument,"
V,II,LEWIS,"To any sovereign state throughout the world."
V,II,LEWIS,"Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars"
V,II,LEWIS,"Between this chastised kingdom and myself,"
V,II,LEWIS,"And brought in matter that should feed this fire;"
V,II,LEWIS,"And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out"
V,II,LEWIS,"With that same weak wind which enkindled it."
V,II,LEWIS,"You taught me how to know the face of right,"
V,II,LEWIS,"Acquainted me with interest to this land,"
V,II,LEWIS,"Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;"
V,II,LEWIS,"And come ye now to tell me John hath made"
V,II,LEWIS,"His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?"
V,II,LEWIS,"I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,"
V,II,LEWIS,"After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;"
V,II,LEWIS,"And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back"
V,II,LEWIS,"Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?"
V,II,LEWIS,"Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,"
V,II,LEWIS,"What men provided, what munition sent,"
V,II,LEWIS,"To underprop this action? Is't not I"
V,II,LEWIS,"That undergo this charge? who else but I,"
V,II,LEWIS,"And such as to my claim are liable,"
V,II,LEWIS,"Sweat in this business and maintain this war?"
V,II,LEWIS,"Have I not heard these islanders shout out"
V,II,LEWIS,"'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?"
V,II,LEWIS,"Have I not here the best cards for the game,"
V,II,LEWIS,"To win this easy match play'd for a crown?"
V,II,LEWIS,"And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?"
V,II,LEWIS,"No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said."
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"You look but on the outside of this work."
V,II,LEWIS,"Outside or inside, I will not return"
V,II,LEWIS,"Till my attempt so much be glorified"
V,II,LEWIS,"As to my ample hope was promised"
V,II,LEWIS,"Before I drew this gallant head of war,"
V,II,LEWIS,"And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,"
V,II,LEWIS,"To outlook conquest and to win renown"
V,II,LEWIS,"Even in the jaws of danger and of death."
V,II,LEWIS,"What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?"
V,II,BASTARD,"According to the fair play of the world,"
V,II,BASTARD,"Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:"
V,II,BASTARD,"My holy lord of Milan, from the king"
V,II,BASTARD,"I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;"
V,II,BASTARD,"And, as you answer, I do know the scope"
V,II,BASTARD,"And warrant limited unto my tongue."
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And will not temporize with my entreaties;"
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms."
V,II,BASTARD,"By all the blood that ever fury breathed,"
V,II,BASTARD,"The youth says well. Now hear our English king;"
V,II,BASTARD,"For thus his royalty doth speak in me."
V,II,BASTARD,"He is prepared, and reason too he should:"
V,II,BASTARD,"This apish and unmannerly approach,"
V,II,BASTARD,"This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,"
V,II,BASTARD,"This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,"
V,II,BASTARD,"The king doth smile at; and is well prepared"
V,II,BASTARD,"To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,"
V,II,BASTARD,"From out the circle of his territories."
V,II,BASTARD,"That hand which had the strength, even at your door,"
V,II,BASTARD,"To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,"
V,II,BASTARD,"To dive like buckets in concealed wells,"
V,II,BASTARD,"To crouch in litter of your stable planks,"
V,II,BASTARD,"To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,"
V,II,BASTARD,"To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out"
V,II,BASTARD,"In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake"
V,II,BASTARD,"Even at the crying of your nation's crow,"
V,II,BASTARD,"Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;"
V,II,BASTARD,"Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,"
V,II,BASTARD,"That in your chambers gave you chastisement?"
V,II,BASTARD,"No: know the gallant monarch is in arms"
V,II,BASTARD,"And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,"
V,II,BASTARD,"To souse annoyance that comes near his nest."
V,II,BASTARD,"And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,"
V,II,BASTARD,"You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb"
V,II,BASTARD,"Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;"
V,II,BASTARD,"For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids"
V,II,BASTARD,"Like Amazons come tripping after drums,"
V,II,BASTARD,"Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,"
V,II,BASTARD,"Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts"
V,II,BASTARD,"To fierce and bloody inclination."
V,II,LEWIS,"There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;"
V,II,LEWIS,"We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;"
V,II,LEWIS,"We hold our time too precious to be spent"
V,II,LEWIS,"With such a brabbler."
V,II,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Give me leave to speak."
V,II,BASTARD,"No, I will speak."
V,II,LEWIS,"We will attend to neither."
V,II,LEWIS,"Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war"
V,II,LEWIS,"Plead for our interest and our being here."
V,II,BASTARD,"Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;"
V,II,BASTARD,"And so shall you, being beaten: do but start"
V,II,BASTARD,"An echo with the clamour of thy drum,"
V,II,BASTARD,"And even at hand a drum is ready braced"
V,II,BASTARD,"That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;"
V,II,BASTARD,"Sound but another, and another shall"
V,II,BASTARD,"As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear"
V,II,BASTARD,"And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,"
V,II,BASTARD,"Not trusting to this halting legate here,"
V,II,BASTARD,"Whom he hath used rather for sport than need"
V,II,BASTARD,"Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits"
V,II,BASTARD,"A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day"
V,II,BASTARD,"To feast upon whole thousands of the French."
V,II,LEWIS,"Strike up our drums, to find this danger out."
V,II,BASTARD,"And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt."
V,III,KING JOHN,"How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert."
V,III,HUBERT,"Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?"
V,III,KING JOHN,"This fever, that hath troubled me so long,"
V,III,KING JOHN,"Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!"
V,III,Messenger,"My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,"
V,III,Messenger,"Desires your majesty to leave the field"
V,III,Messenger,"And send him word by me which way you go."
V,III,KING JOHN,"Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there."
V,III,Messenger,"Be of good comfort; for the great supply"
V,III,Messenger,"That was expected by the Dauphin here,"
V,III,Messenger,"Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands."
V,III,Messenger,"This news was brought to Richard but even now:"
V,III,Messenger,"The French fight coldly, and retire themselves."
V,III,KING JOHN,"Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,"
V,III,KING JOHN,"And will not let me welcome this good news."
V,III,KING JOHN,"Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;"
V,III,KING JOHN,"Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint."
V,IV,SALISBURY,"I did not think the king so stored with friends."
V,IV,PEMBROKE,"Up once again; put spirit in the French:"
V,IV,PEMBROKE,"If they miscarry, we miscarry too."
V,IV,SALISBURY,"That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"In spite of spite, alone upholds the day."
V,IV,PEMBROKE,"They say King John sore sick hath left the field."
V,IV,MELUN,"Lead me to the revolts of England here."
V,IV,SALISBURY,"When we were happy we had other names."
V,IV,PEMBROKE,"It is the Count Melun."
V,IV,SALISBURY,"Wounded to death."
V,IV,MELUN,"Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;"
V,IV,MELUN,"Unthread the rude eye of rebellion"
V,IV,MELUN,"And welcome home again discarded faith."
V,IV,MELUN,"Seek out King John and fall before his feet;"
V,IV,MELUN,"For if the French be lords of this loud day,"
V,IV,MELUN,"He means to recompense the pains you take"
V,IV,MELUN,"By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn"
V,IV,MELUN,"And I with him, and many moe with me,"
V,IV,MELUN,"Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;"
V,IV,MELUN,"Even on that altar where we swore to you"
V,IV,MELUN,"Dear amity and everlasting love."
V,IV,SALISBURY,"May this be possible? may this be true?"
V,IV,MELUN,"Have I not hideous death within my view,"
V,IV,MELUN,"Retaining but a quantity of life,"
V,IV,MELUN,"Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax"
V,IV,MELUN,"Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?"
V,IV,MELUN,"What in the world should make me now deceive,"
V,IV,MELUN,"Since I must lose the use of all deceit?"
V,IV,MELUN,"Why should I then be false, since it is true"
V,IV,MELUN,"That I must die here and live hence by truth?"
V,IV,MELUN,"I say again, if Lewis do win the day,"
V,IV,MELUN,"He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours"
V,IV,MELUN,"Behold another day break in the east:"
V,IV,MELUN,"But even this night, whose black contagious breath"
V,IV,MELUN,"Already smokes about the burning crest"
V,IV,MELUN,"Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,"
V,IV,MELUN,"Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,"
V,IV,MELUN,"Paying the fine of rated treachery"
V,IV,MELUN,"Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,"
V,IV,MELUN,"If Lewis by your assistance win the day."
V,IV,MELUN,"Commend me to one Hubert with your king:"
V,IV,MELUN,"The love of him, and this respect besides,"
V,IV,MELUN,"For that my grandsire was an Englishman,"
V,IV,MELUN,"Awakes my conscience to confess all this."
V,IV,MELUN,"In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence"
V,IV,MELUN,"From forth the noise and rumour of the field,"
V,IV,MELUN,"Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts"
V,IV,MELUN,"In peace, and part this body and my soul"
V,IV,MELUN,"With contemplation and devout desires."
V,IV,SALISBURY,"We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"But I do love the favour and the form"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"Of this most fair occasion, by the which"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"We will untread the steps of damned flight,"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"And like a bated and retired flood,"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"Leaving our rankness and irregular course,"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"And cabby run on in obedience"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"Even to our ocean, to our great King John."
V,IV,SALISBURY,"My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"For I do see the cruel pangs of death"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;"
V,IV,SALISBURY,"And happy newness, that intends old right."
V,V,LEWIS,"The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,"
V,V,LEWIS,"But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,"
V,V,LEWIS,"When English measure backward their own ground"
V,V,LEWIS,"In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,"
V,V,LEWIS,"When with a volley of our needless shot,"
V,V,LEWIS,"After such bloody toil, we bid good night;"
V,V,LEWIS,"And wound our tattering colours clearly up,"
V,V,LEWIS,"Last in the field, and almost lords of it!"
V,V,Messenger,"Where is my prince, the Dauphin?"
V,V,LEWIS,"Here: what news?"
V,V,Messenger,"The Count Melun is slain; the English lords"
V,V,Messenger,"By his persuasion are again fall'n off,"
V,V,Messenger,"And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,"
V,V,Messenger,"Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands."
V,V,LEWIS,"Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!"
V,V,LEWIS,"I did not think to be so sad to-night"
V,V,LEWIS,"As this hath made me. Who was he that said"
V,V,LEWIS,"King John did fly an hour or two before"
V,V,LEWIS,"The stumbling night did part our weary powers?"
V,V,Messenger,"Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord."
V,V,LEWIS,"Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:"
V,V,LEWIS,"The day shall not be up so soon as I,"
V,V,LEWIS,"To try the fair adventure of to-morrow."
V,VI,HUBERT,"Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot."
V,VI,BASTARD,"A friend. What art thou?"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Of the part of England."
V,VI,BASTARD,"Whither dost thou go?"
V,VI,HUBERT,"What's that to thee? why may not I demand"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?"
V,VI,BASTARD,"Hubert, I think?"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Thou hast a perfect thought:"
V,VI,HUBERT,"I will upon all hazards well believe"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well."
V,VI,HUBERT,"Who art thou?"
V,VI,BASTARD,"Who thou wilt: and if thou please,"
V,VI,BASTARD,"Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think"
V,VI,BASTARD,"I come one way of the Plantagenets."
V,VI,HUBERT,"Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,"
V,VI,HUBERT,"That any accent breaking from thy tongue"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear."
V,VI,BASTARD,"Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,"
V,VI,HUBERT,"To find you out."
V,VI,BASTARD,"Brief, then; and what's the news?"
V,VI,HUBERT,"O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible."
V,VI,BASTARD,"Show me the very wound of this ill news:"
V,VI,BASTARD,"I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it."
V,VI,HUBERT,"The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:"
V,VI,HUBERT,"I left him almost speechless; and broke out"
V,VI,HUBERT,"To acquaint you with this evil, that you might"
V,VI,HUBERT,"The better arm you to the sudden time,"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Than if you had at leisure known of this."
V,VI,BASTARD,"How did he take it? who did taste to him?"
V,VI,HUBERT,"A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Yet speaks and peradventure may recover."
V,VI,BASTARD,"Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?"
V,VI,HUBERT,"Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,"
V,VI,HUBERT,"And brought Prince Henry in their company;"
V,VI,HUBERT,"At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,"
V,VI,HUBERT,"And they are all about his majesty."
V,VI,BASTARD,"Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,"
V,VI,BASTARD,"And tempt us not to bear above our power!"
V,VI,BASTARD,"I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,"
V,VI,BASTARD,"Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;"
V,VI,BASTARD,"These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;"
V,VI,BASTARD,"Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped."
V,VI,BASTARD,"Away before: conduct me to the king;"
V,VI,BASTARD,"I doubt he will be dead or ere I come."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"It is too late: the life of all his blood"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Doth by the idle comments that it makes"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Foretell the ending of mortality."
V,VII,PEMBROKE,"His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief"
V,VII,PEMBROKE,"That, being brought into the open air,"
V,VII,PEMBROKE,"It would allay the burning quality"
V,VII,PEMBROKE,"Of that fell poison which assaileth him."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Let him be brought into the orchard here."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Doth he still rage?"
V,VII,PEMBROKE,"He is more patient"
V,VII,PEMBROKE,"Than when you left him; even now he sung."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"In their continuance will not feel themselves."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"With many legions of strange fantasies,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"should sing."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"His soul and body to their lasting rest."
V,VII,SALISBURY,"Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"To set a form upon that indigest"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude."
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"It would not out at windows nor at doors."
V,VII,KING JOHN,"There is so hot a summer in my bosom,"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"That all my bowels crumble up to dust:"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Upon a parchment, and against this fire"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Do I shrink up."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"How fares your majesty?"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"And none of you will bid the winter come"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"And so ingrateful, you deny me that."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"O that there were some virtue in my tears,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"That might relieve you!"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"The salt in them is hot."
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Within me is a hell; and there the poison"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"On unreprievable condemned blood."
V,VII,BASTARD,"O, I am scalded with my violent motion,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"And spleen of speed to see your majesty!"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Are turned to one thread, one little hair:"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"Which holds but till thy news be uttered;"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"And then all this thou seest is but a clod"
V,VII,KING JOHN,"And module of confounded royalty."
V,VII,BASTARD,"The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;"
V,VII,BASTARD,"For in a night the best part of my power,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"As I upon advantage did remove,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Were in the Washes all unwarily"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Devoured by the unexpected flood."
V,VII,SALISBURY,"You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear."
V,VII,SALISBURY,"My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"Even so must I run on, and even so stop."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"When this was now a king, and now is clay?"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind"
V,VII,BASTARD,"To do the office for thee of revenge,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"As it on earth hath been thy servant still."
V,VII,BASTARD,"Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"And instantly return with me again,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"To push destruction and perpetual shame"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Out of the weak door of our fainting land."
V,VII,BASTARD,"Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;"
V,VII,BASTARD,"The Dauphin rages at our very heels."
V,VII,SALISBURY,"It seems you know not, then, so much as we:"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"And brings from him such offers of our peace"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"As we with honour and respect may take,"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"With purpose presently to leave this war."
V,VII,BASTARD,"He will the rather do it when he sees"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Ourselves well sinewed to our defence."
V,VII,SALISBURY,"Nay, it is in a manner done already;"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"For many carriages he hath dispatch'd"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"To the disposing of the cardinal:"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"With whom yourself, myself and other lords,"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"If you think meet, this afternoon will post"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"To consummate this business happily."
V,VII,BASTARD,"Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"With other princes that may best be spared,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Shall wait upon your father's funeral."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"At Worcester must his body be interr'd;"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"For so he will'd it."
V,VII,BASTARD,"Thither shall it then:"
V,VII,BASTARD,"And happily may your sweet self put on"
V,VII,BASTARD,"The lineal state and glory of the land!"
V,VII,BASTARD,"To whom with all submission, on my knee"
V,VII,BASTARD,"I do bequeath my faithful services"
V,VII,BASTARD,"And true subjection everlastingly."
V,VII,SALISBURY,"And the like tender of our love we make,"
V,VII,SALISBURY,"To rest without a spot for evermore."
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"I have a kind soul that would give you thanks"
V,VII,PRINCE HENRY,"And knows not how to do it but with tears."
V,VII,BASTARD,"O, let us pay the time but needful woe,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs."
V,VII,BASTARD,"This England never did, nor never shall,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"But when it first did help to wound itself."
V,VII,BASTARD,"Now these her princes are come home again,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"Come the three corners of the world in arms,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,"
V,VII,BASTARD,"If England to itself do rest but true."
