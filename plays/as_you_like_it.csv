I,I,ORLANDO,"As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion"
I,I,ORLANDO,"bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,"
I,I,ORLANDO,"and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his"
I,I,ORLANDO,"blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my"
I,I,ORLANDO,"sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and"
I,I,ORLANDO,"report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,"
I,I,ORLANDO,"he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more"
I,I,ORLANDO,"properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you"
I,I,ORLANDO,"that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that"
I,I,ORLANDO,"differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses"
I,I,ORLANDO,"are bred better; for, besides that they are fair"
I,I,ORLANDO,"with their feeding, they are taught their manage,"
I,I,ORLANDO,"and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his"
I,I,ORLANDO,"brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the"
I,I,ORLANDO,"which his animals on his dunghills are as much"
I,I,ORLANDO,"bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so"
I,I,ORLANDO,"plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave"
I,I,ORLANDO,"me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets"
I,I,ORLANDO,"me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a"
I,I,ORLANDO,"brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my"
I,I,ORLANDO,"gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that"
I,I,ORLANDO,"grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I"
I,I,ORLANDO,"think is within me, begins to mutiny against this"
I,I,ORLANDO,"servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I"
I,I,ORLANDO,"know no wise remedy how to avoid it."
I,I,ADAM,"Yonder comes my master, your brother."
I,I,ORLANDO,"Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will"
I,I,ORLANDO,"shake me up."
I,I,OLIVER,"Now, sir! what make you here?"
I,I,ORLANDO,"Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing."
I,I,OLIVER,"What mar you then, sir?"
I,I,ORLANDO,"Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God"
I,I,ORLANDO,"made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness."
I,I,OLIVER,"Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile."
I,I,ORLANDO,"Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?"
I,I,ORLANDO,"What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should"
I,I,ORLANDO,"come to such penury?"
I,I,OLIVER,"Know you where your are, sir?"
I,I,ORLANDO,"O, sir, very well; here in your orchard."
I,I,OLIVER,"Know you before whom, sir?"
I,I,ORLANDO,"Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know"
I,I,ORLANDO,"you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle"
I,I,ORLANDO,"condition of blood, you should so know me. The"
I,I,ORLANDO,"courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that"
I,I,ORLANDO,"you are the first-born; but the same tradition"
I,I,ORLANDO,"takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers"
I,I,ORLANDO,"betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as"
I,I,ORLANDO,"you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is"
I,I,ORLANDO,"nearer to his reverence."
I,I,OLIVER,"What, boy!"
I,I,ORLANDO,"Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this."
I,I,OLIVER,"Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?"
I,I,ORLANDO,"I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir"
I,I,ORLANDO,"Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice"
I,I,ORLANDO,"a villain that says such a father begot villains."
I,I,ORLANDO,"Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand"
I,I,ORLANDO,"from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy"
I,I,ORLANDO,"tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself."
I,I,ADAM,"Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's"
I,I,ADAM,"remembrance, be at accord."
I,I,OLIVER,"Let me go, I say."
I,I,ORLANDO,"I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My"
I,I,ORLANDO,"father charged you in his will to give me good"
I,I,ORLANDO,"education: you have trained me like a peasant,"
I,I,ORLANDO,"obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like"
I,I,ORLANDO,"qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in"
I,I,ORLANDO,"me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow"
I,I,ORLANDO,"me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or"
I,I,ORLANDO,"give me the poor allottery my father left me by"
I,I,ORLANDO,"testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes."
I,I,OLIVER,"And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?"
I,I,OLIVER,"Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled"
I,I,OLIVER,"with you; you shall have some part of your will: I"
I,I,OLIVER,"pray you, leave me."
I,I,ORLANDO,"I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good."
I,I,OLIVER,"Get you with him, you old dog."
I,I,ADAM,"Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my"
I,I,ADAM,"teeth in your service. God be with my old master!"
I,I,ADAM,"he would not have spoke such a word."
I,I,OLIVER,"Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will"
I,I,OLIVER,"physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand"
I,I,OLIVER,"crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!"
I,I,DENNIS,"Calls your worship?"
I,I,OLIVER,"Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?"
I,I,DENNIS,"So please you, he is here at the door and importunes"
I,I,DENNIS,"access to you."
I,I,OLIVER,"Call him in."
I,I,OLIVER,"'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is."
I,I,CHARLES,"Good morrow to your worship."
I,I,OLIVER,"Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the"
I,I,OLIVER,"new court?"
I,I,CHARLES,"There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:"
I,I,CHARLES,"that is, the old duke is banished by his younger"
I,I,CHARLES,"brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords"
I,I,CHARLES,"have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,"
I,I,CHARLES,"whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;"
I,I,CHARLES,"therefore he gives them good leave to wander."
I,I,OLIVER,"Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be"
I,I,OLIVER,"banished with her father?"
I,I,CHARLES,"O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves"
I,I,CHARLES,"her, being ever from their cradles bred together,"
I,I,CHARLES,"that she would have followed her exile, or have died"
I,I,CHARLES,"to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no"
I,I,CHARLES,"less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and"
I,I,CHARLES,"never two ladies loved as they do."
I,I,OLIVER,"Where will the old duke live?"
I,I,CHARLES,"They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and"
I,I,CHARLES,"a many merry men with him; and there they live like"
I,I,CHARLES,"the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young"
I,I,CHARLES,"gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time"
I,I,CHARLES,"carelessly, as they did in the golden world."
I,I,OLIVER,"What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?"
I,I,CHARLES,"Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a"
I,I,CHARLES,"matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand"
I,I,CHARLES,"that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition"
I,I,CHARLES,"to come in disguised against me to try a fall."
I,I,CHARLES,"To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that"
I,I,CHARLES,"escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him"
I,I,CHARLES,"well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,"
I,I,CHARLES,"for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I"
I,I,CHARLES,"must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,"
I,I,CHARLES,"out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you"
I,I,CHARLES,"withal, that either you might stay him from his"
I,I,CHARLES,"intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall"
I,I,CHARLES,"run into, in that it is a thing of his own search"
I,I,CHARLES,"and altogether against my will."
I,I,OLIVER,"Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which"
I,I,OLIVER,"thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had"
I,I,OLIVER,"myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and"
I,I,OLIVER,"have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from"
I,I,OLIVER,"it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:"
I,I,OLIVER,"it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full"
I,I,OLIVER,"of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's"
I,I,OLIVER,"good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against"
I,I,OLIVER,"me his natural brother: therefore use thy"
I,I,OLIVER,"discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck"
I,I,OLIVER,"as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if"
I,I,OLIVER,"thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not"
I,I,OLIVER,"mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise"
I,I,OLIVER,"against thee by poison, entrap thee by some"
I,I,OLIVER,"treacherous device and never leave thee till he"
I,I,OLIVER,"hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;"
I,I,OLIVER,"for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak"
I,I,OLIVER,"it, there is not one so young and so villanous this"
I,I,OLIVER,"day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but"
I,I,OLIVER,"should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must"
I,I,OLIVER,"blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder."
I,I,CHARLES,"I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come"
I,I,CHARLES,"to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go"
I,I,CHARLES,"alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and"
I,I,CHARLES,"so God keep your worship!"
I,I,OLIVER,"Farewell, good Charles."
I,I,OLIVER,"Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see"
I,I,OLIVER,"an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,"
I,I,OLIVER,"hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never"
I,I,OLIVER,"schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of"
I,I,OLIVER,"all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much"
I,I,OLIVER,"in the heart of the world, and especially of my own"
I,I,OLIVER,"people, who best know him, that I am altogether"
I,I,OLIVER,"misprised: but it shall not be so long; this"
I,I,OLIVER,"wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that"
I,I,OLIVER,"I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about."
I,II,CELIA,"I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;"
I,II,ROSALIND,"and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could"
I,II,ROSALIND,"teach me to forget a banished father, you must not"
I,II,ROSALIND,"learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure."
I,II,CELIA,"Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight"
I,II,CELIA,"that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,"
I,II,CELIA,"had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou"
I,II,CELIA,"hadst been still with me, I could have taught my"
I,II,CELIA,"love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,"
I,II,CELIA,"if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously"
I,II,CELIA,"tempered as mine is to thee."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to"
I,II,ROSALIND,"rejoice in yours."
I,II,CELIA,"You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is"
I,II,CELIA,"like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt"
I,II,CELIA,"be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy"
I,II,CELIA,"father perforce, I will render thee again in"
I,II,CELIA,"affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break"
I,II,CELIA,"that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my"
I,II,CELIA,"sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry."
I,II,ROSALIND,"From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let"
I,II,ROSALIND,"me see; what think you of falling in love?"
I,II,CELIA,"Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but"
I,II,CELIA,"love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport"
I,II,CELIA,"neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst"
I,II,CELIA,"in honour come off again."
I,II,ROSALIND,"What shall be our sport, then?"
I,II,CELIA,"Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from"
I,II,CELIA,"her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally."
I,II,ROSALIND,"I would we could do so, for her benefits are"
I,II,ROSALIND,"mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman"
I,II,ROSALIND,"doth most mistake in her gifts to women."
I,II,CELIA,"'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce"
I,II,CELIA,"makes honest, and those that she makes honest she"
I,II,CELIA,"makes very ill-favouredly."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,"
I,II,ROSALIND,"not in the lineaments of Nature."
I,II,CELIA,"No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she"
I,II,CELIA,"not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature"
I,II,CELIA,"hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not"
I,II,CELIA,"Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Nature's wit."
I,II,CELIA,"Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but"
I,II,CELIA,"Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull"
I,II,CELIA,"to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this"
I,II,CELIA,"natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of"
I,II,CELIA,"the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,"
I,II,CELIA,"wit! whither wander you?"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Mistress, you must come away to your father."
I,II,CELIA,"Were you made the messenger?"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Where learned you that oath, fool?"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"were good pancakes and swore by his honour the"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"yet was not the knight forsworn."
I,II,CELIA,"How prove you that, in the great heap of your"
I,II,CELIA,"knowledge?"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom."
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"swear by your beards that I am a knave."
I,II,CELIA,"By our beards, if we had them, thou art."
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard."
I,II,CELIA,"Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"One that old Frederick, your father, loves."
I,II,CELIA,"My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!"
I,II,CELIA,"speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation"
I,II,CELIA,"one of these days."
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"wise men do foolishly."
I,II,CELIA,"By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little"
I,II,CELIA,"wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery"
I,II,CELIA,"that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes"
I,II,CELIA,"Monsieur Le Beau."
I,II,ROSALIND,"With his mouth full of news."
I,II,CELIA,"Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Then shall we be news-crammed."
I,II,CELIA,"All the better; we shall be the more marketable."
I,II,CELIA,"Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Fair princess, you have lost much good sport."
I,II,CELIA,"Sport! of what colour?"
I,II,LE BEAU,"What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?"
I,II,ROSALIND,"As wit and fortune will."
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Or as the Destinies decree."
I,II,CELIA,"Well said: that was laid on with a trowel."
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Nay, if I keep not my rank,--"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Thou losest thy old smell."
I,II,LE BEAU,"You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good"
I,II,LE BEAU,"wrestling, which you have lost the sight of."
I,II,ROSALIND,"You tell us the manner of the wrestling."
I,II,LE BEAU,"I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please"
I,II,LE BEAU,"your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is"
I,II,LE BEAU,"yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming"
I,II,LE BEAU,"to perform it."
I,II,CELIA,"Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried."
I,II,LE BEAU,"There comes an old man and his three sons,--"
I,II,CELIA,"I could match this beginning with an old tale."
I,II,LE BEAU,"Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence."
I,II,ROSALIND,"With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men"
I,II,ROSALIND,"by these presents.'"
I,II,LE BEAU,"The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the"
I,II,LE BEAU,"duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him"
I,II,LE BEAU,"and broke three of his ribs, that there is little"
I,II,LE BEAU,"hope of life in him: so he served the second, and"
I,II,LE BEAU,"so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,"
I,II,LE BEAU,"their father, making such pitiful dole over them"
I,II,LE BEAU,"that all the beholders take his part with weeping."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Alas!"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"have lost?"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Why, this that I speak of."
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport"
I,II,TOUCHSTONE,"for ladies."
I,II,CELIA,"Or I, I promise thee."
I,II,ROSALIND,"But is there any else longs to see this broken music"
I,II,ROSALIND,"in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon"
I,II,ROSALIND,"rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?"
I,II,LE BEAU,"You must, if you stay here; for here is the place"
I,II,LE BEAU,"appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to"
I,II,LE BEAU,"perform it."
I,II,CELIA,"Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"own peril on his forwardness."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Is yonder the man?"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Even he, madam."
I,II,CELIA,"Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"to see the wrestling?"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"there is such odds in the man. In pity of the"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"you can move him."
I,II,CELIA,"Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"Do so: I'll not be by."
I,II,LE BEAU,"Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you."
I,II,ORLANDO,"I attend them with all respect and duty."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?"
I,II,ORLANDO,"No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I"
I,II,ORLANDO,"come but in, as others do, to try with him the"
I,II,ORLANDO,"strength of my youth."
I,II,CELIA,"Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your"
I,II,CELIA,"years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's"
I,II,CELIA,"strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or"
I,II,CELIA,"knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your"
I,II,CELIA,"adventure would counsel you to a more equal"
I,II,CELIA,"enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to"
I,II,CELIA,"embrace your own safety and give over this attempt."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore"
I,II,ROSALIND,"be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke"
I,II,ROSALIND,"that the wrestling might not go forward."
I,II,ORLANDO,"I beseech you, punish me not with your hard"
I,II,ORLANDO,"thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny"
I,II,ORLANDO,"so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let"
I,II,ORLANDO,"your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my"
I,II,ORLANDO,"trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one"
I,II,ORLANDO,"shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one"
I,II,ORLANDO,"dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my"
I,II,ORLANDO,"friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the"
I,II,ORLANDO,"world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in"
I,II,ORLANDO,"the world I fill up a place, which may be better"
I,II,ORLANDO,"supplied when I have made it empty."
I,II,ROSALIND,"The little strength that I have, I would it were with you."
I,II,CELIA,"And mine, to eke out hers."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!"
I,II,CELIA,"Your heart's desires be with you!"
I,II,CHARLES,"Come, where is this young gallant that is so"
I,II,CHARLES,"desirous to lie with his mother earth?"
I,II,ORLANDO,"Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"You shall try but one fall."
I,II,CHARLES,"No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him"
I,II,CHARLES,"to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him"
I,II,CHARLES,"from a first."
I,II,ORLANDO,"An you mean to mock me after, you should not have"
I,II,ORLANDO,"mocked me before: but come your ways."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!"
I,II,CELIA,"I would I were invisible, to catch the strong"
I,II,CELIA,"fellow by the leg."
I,II,ROSALIND,"O excellent young man!"
I,II,CELIA,"If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who"
I,II,CELIA,"should down."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"No more, no more."
I,II,ORLANDO,"Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"How dost thou, Charles?"
I,II,LE BEAU,"He cannot speak, my lord."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?"
I,II,ORLANDO,"Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"I would thou hadst been son to some man else:"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"The world esteem'd thy father honourable,"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"But I did find him still mine enemy:"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"Hadst thou descended from another house."
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:"
I,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"I would thou hadst told me of another father."
I,II,CELIA,"Were I my father, coz, would I do this?"
I,II,ORLANDO,"I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,"
I,II,ORLANDO,"His youngest son; and would not change that calling,"
I,II,ORLANDO,"To be adopted heir to Frederick."
I,II,ROSALIND,"My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,"
I,II,ROSALIND,"And all the world was of my father's mind:"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Had I before known this young man his son,"
I,II,ROSALIND,"I should have given him tears unto entreaties,"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Ere he should thus have ventured."
I,II,CELIA,"Gentle cousin,"
I,II,CELIA,"Let us go thank him and encourage him:"
I,II,CELIA,"My father's rough and envious disposition"
I,II,CELIA,"Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:"
I,II,CELIA,"If you do keep your promises in love"
I,II,CELIA,"But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,"
I,II,CELIA,"Your mistress shall be happy."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Gentleman,"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,"
I,II,ROSALIND,"That could give more, but that her hand lacks means."
I,II,ROSALIND,"Shall we go, coz?"
I,II,CELIA,"Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman."
I,II,ORLANDO,"Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts"
I,II,ORLANDO,"Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up"
I,II,ORLANDO,"Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block."
I,II,ROSALIND,"He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;"
I,II,ROSALIND,"I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown"
I,II,ROSALIND,"More than your enemies."
I,II,CELIA,"Will you go, coz?"
I,II,ROSALIND,"Have with you. Fare you well."
I,II,ORLANDO,"What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?"
I,II,ORLANDO,"I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference."
I,II,ORLANDO,"O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!"
I,II,ORLANDO,"Or Charles or something weaker masters thee."
I,II,LE BEAU,"Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you"
I,II,LE BEAU,"To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved"
I,II,LE BEAU,"High commendation, true applause and love,"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Yet such is now the duke's condition"
I,II,LE BEAU,"That he misconstrues all that you have done."
I,II,LE BEAU,"The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,"
I,II,LE BEAU,"More suits you to conceive than I to speak of."
I,II,ORLANDO,"I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:"
I,II,ORLANDO,"Which of the two was daughter of the duke"
I,II,ORLANDO,"That here was at the wrestling?"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;"
I,II,LE BEAU,"But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter"
I,II,LE BEAU,"The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,"
I,II,LE BEAU,"And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,"
I,II,LE BEAU,"To keep his daughter company; whose loves"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters."
I,II,LE BEAU,"But I can tell you that of late this duke"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Grounded upon no other argument"
I,II,LE BEAU,"But that the people praise her for her virtues"
I,II,LE BEAU,"And pity her for her good father's sake;"
I,II,LE BEAU,"And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:"
I,II,LE BEAU,"Hereafter, in a better world than this,"
I,II,LE BEAU,"I shall desire more love and knowledge of you."
I,II,ORLANDO,"I rest much bounden to you: fare you well."
I,II,ORLANDO,"Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;"
I,II,ORLANDO,"From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:"
I,II,ORLANDO,"But heavenly Rosalind!"
I,III,CELIA,"Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Not one to throw at a dog."
I,III,CELIA,"No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon"
I,III,CELIA,"curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons."
I,III,ROSALIND,"Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one"
I,III,ROSALIND,"should be lamed with reasons and the other mad"
I,III,ROSALIND,"without any."
I,III,CELIA,"But is all this for your father?"
I,III,ROSALIND,"No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how"
I,III,ROSALIND,"full of briers is this working-day world!"
I,III,CELIA,"They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in"
I,III,CELIA,"holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden"
I,III,CELIA,"paths our very petticoats will catch them."
I,III,ROSALIND,"I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart."
I,III,CELIA,"Hem them away."
I,III,ROSALIND,"I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him."
I,III,CELIA,"Come, come, wrestle with thy affections."
I,III,ROSALIND,"O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!"
I,III,CELIA,"O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in"
I,III,CELIA,"despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of"
I,III,CELIA,"service, let us talk in good earnest: is it"
I,III,CELIA,"possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so"
I,III,CELIA,"strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?"
I,III,ROSALIND,"The duke my father loved his father dearly."
I,III,CELIA,"Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son"
I,III,CELIA,"dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,"
I,III,CELIA,"for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate"
I,III,CELIA,"not Orlando."
I,III,ROSALIND,"No, faith, hate him not, for my sake."
I,III,CELIA,"Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Let me love him for that, and do you love him"
I,III,ROSALIND,"because I do. Look, here comes the duke."
I,III,CELIA,"With his eyes full of anger."
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"And get you from our court."
I,III,ROSALIND,"Me, uncle?"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"You, cousin"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Within these ten days if that thou be'st found"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"So near our public court as twenty miles,"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou diest for it."
I,III,ROSALIND,"I do beseech your grace,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:"
I,III,ROSALIND,"If with myself I hold intelligence"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--"
I,III,ROSALIND,"As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Never so much as in a thought unborn"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Did I offend your highness."
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thus do all traitors:"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"If their purgation did consist in words,"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"They are as innocent as grace itself:"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not."
I,III,ROSALIND,"Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Tell me whereon the likelihood depends."
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough."
I,III,ROSALIND,"So was I when your highness took his dukedom;"
I,III,ROSALIND,"So was I when your highness banish'd him:"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Treason is not inherited, my lord;"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Or, if we did derive it from our friends,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"What's that to me? my father was no traitor:"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much"
I,III,ROSALIND,"To think my poverty is treacherous."
I,III,CELIA,"Dear sovereign, hear me speak."
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Else had she with her father ranged along."
I,III,CELIA,"I did not then entreat to have her stay;"
I,III,CELIA,"It was your pleasure and your own remorse:"
I,III,CELIA,"I was too young that time to value her;"
I,III,CELIA,"But now I know her: if she be a traitor,"
I,III,CELIA,"Why so am I; we still have slept together,"
I,III,CELIA,"Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,"
I,III,CELIA,"And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,"
I,III,CELIA,"Still we went coupled and inseparable."
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Her very silence and her patience"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Speak to the people, and they pity her."
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Firm and irrevocable is my doom"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd."
I,III,CELIA,"Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:"
I,III,CELIA,"I cannot live out of her company."
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,"
I,III,DUKE FREDERICK,"And in the greatness of my word, you die."
I,III,CELIA,"O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?"
I,III,CELIA,"Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine."
I,III,CELIA,"I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am."
I,III,ROSALIND,"I have more cause."
I,III,CELIA,"Thou hast not, cousin;"
I,III,CELIA,"Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke"
I,III,CELIA,"Hath banish'd me, his daughter?"
I,III,ROSALIND,"That he hath not."
I,III,CELIA,"No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love"
I,III,CELIA,"Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:"
I,III,CELIA,"Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?"
I,III,CELIA,"No: let my father seek another heir."
I,III,CELIA,"Therefore devise with me how we may fly,"
I,III,CELIA,"Whither to go and what to bear with us;"
I,III,CELIA,"And do not seek to take your change upon you,"
I,III,CELIA,"To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;"
I,III,CELIA,"For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,"
I,III,CELIA,"Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee."
I,III,ROSALIND,"Why, whither shall we go?"
I,III,CELIA,"To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden."
I,III,ROSALIND,"Alas, what danger will it be to us,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold."
I,III,CELIA,"I'll put myself in poor and mean attire"
I,III,CELIA,"And with a kind of umber smirch my face;"
I,III,CELIA,"The like do you: so shall we pass along"
I,III,CELIA,"And never stir assailants."
I,III,ROSALIND,"Were it not better,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Because that I am more than common tall,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"That I did suit me all points like a man?"
I,III,ROSALIND,"A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--"
I,III,ROSALIND,"We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,"
I,III,ROSALIND,"As many other mannish cowards have"
I,III,ROSALIND,"That do outface it with their semblances."
I,III,CELIA,"What shall I call thee when thou art a man?"
I,III,ROSALIND,"I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;"
I,III,ROSALIND,"And therefore look you call me Ganymede."
I,III,ROSALIND,"But what will you be call'd?"
I,III,CELIA,"Something that hath a reference to my state"
I,III,CELIA,"No longer Celia, but Aliena."
I,III,ROSALIND,"But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal"
I,III,ROSALIND,"The clownish fool out of your father's court?"
I,III,ROSALIND,"Would he not be a comfort to our travel?"
I,III,CELIA,"He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;"
I,III,CELIA,"Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,"
I,III,CELIA,"And get our jewels and our wealth together,"
I,III,CELIA,"Devise the fittest time and safest way"
I,III,CELIA,"To hide us from pursuit that will be made"
I,III,CELIA,"After my flight. Now go we in content"
I,III,CELIA,"To liberty and not to banishment."
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Hath not old custom made this life more sweet"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"More free from peril than the envious court?"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"The seasons' difference, as the icy fang"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"'This is no flattery: these are counsellors"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"That feelingly persuade me what I am.'"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Sweet are the uses of adversity,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"And this our life exempt from public haunt"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Sermons in stones and good in every thing."
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"I would not change it."
II,I,AMIENS,"Happy is your grace,"
II,I,AMIENS,"That can translate the stubbornness of fortune"
II,I,AMIENS,"Into so quiet and so sweet a style."
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Come, shall we go and kill us venison?"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Being native burghers of this desert city,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Should in their own confines with forked heads"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Have their round haunches gored."
II,I,First Lord,"Indeed, my lord,"
II,I,First Lord,"The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,"
II,I,First Lord,"And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp"
II,I,First Lord,"Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you."
II,I,First Lord,"To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself"
II,I,First Lord,"Did steal behind him as he lay along"
II,I,First Lord,"Under an oak whose antique root peeps out"
II,I,First Lord,"Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:"
II,I,First Lord,"To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,"
II,I,First Lord,"That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,"
II,I,First Lord,"Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,"
II,I,First Lord,"The wretched animal heaved forth such groans"
II,I,First Lord,"That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat"
II,I,First Lord,"Almost to bursting, and the big round tears"
II,I,First Lord,"Coursed one another down his innocent nose"
II,I,First Lord,"In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool"
II,I,First Lord,"Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,"
II,I,First Lord,"Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,"
II,I,First Lord,"Augmenting it with tears."
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"But what said Jaques?"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Did he not moralize this spectacle?"
II,I,First Lord,"O, yes, into a thousand similes."
II,I,First Lord,"First, for his weeping into the needless stream;"
II,I,First Lord,"'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament"
II,I,First Lord,"As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more"
II,I,First Lord,"To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,"
II,I,First Lord,"Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,"
II,I,First Lord,"''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part"
II,I,First Lord,"The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,"
II,I,First Lord,"Full of the pasture, jumps along by him"
II,I,First Lord,"And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,"
II,I,First Lord,"'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;"
II,I,First Lord,"'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look"
II,I,First Lord,"Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'"
II,I,First Lord,"Thus most invectively he pierceth through"
II,I,First Lord,"The body of the country, city, court,"
II,I,First Lord,"Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we"
II,I,First Lord,"Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,"
II,I,First Lord,"To fright the animals and to kill them up"
II,I,First Lord,"In their assign'd and native dwelling-place."
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"And did you leave him in this contemplation?"
II,I,Second Lord,"We did, my lord, weeping and commenting"
II,I,Second Lord,"Upon the sobbing deer."
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"Show me the place:"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"I love to cope him in these sullen fits,"
II,I,DUKE SENIOR,"For then he's full of matter."
II,I,First Lord,"I'll bring you to him straight."
II,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"Can it be possible that no man saw them?"
II,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"It cannot be: some villains of my court"
II,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"Are of consent and sufferance in this."
II,II,First Lord,"I cannot hear of any that did see her."
II,II,First Lord,"The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,"
II,II,First Lord,"Saw her abed, and in the morning early"
II,II,First Lord,"They found the bed untreasured of their mistress."
II,II,Second Lord,"My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft"
II,II,Second Lord,"Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing."
II,II,Second Lord,"Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,"
II,II,Second Lord,"Confesses that she secretly o'erheard"
II,II,Second Lord,"Your daughter and her cousin much commend"
II,II,Second Lord,"The parts and graces of the wrestler"
II,II,Second Lord,"That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;"
II,II,Second Lord,"And she believes, wherever they are gone,"
II,II,Second Lord,"That youth is surely in their company."
II,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;"
II,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"If he be absent, bring his brother to me;"
II,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,"
II,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"And let not search and inquisition quail"
II,II,DUKE FREDERICK,"To bring again these foolish runaways."
II,III,ORLANDO,"Who's there?"
II,III,ADAM,"What, my young master? O, my gentle master!"
II,III,ADAM,"O my sweet master! O you memory"
II,III,ADAM,"Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?"
II,III,ADAM,"Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?"
II,III,ADAM,"And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?"
II,III,ADAM,"Why would you be so fond to overcome"
II,III,ADAM,"The bonny priser of the humorous duke?"
II,III,ADAM,"Your praise is come too swiftly home before you."
II,III,ADAM,"Know you not, master, to some kind of men"
II,III,ADAM,"Their graces serve them but as enemies?"
II,III,ADAM,"No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,"
II,III,ADAM,"Are sanctified and holy traitors to you."
II,III,ADAM,"O, what a world is this, when what is comely"
II,III,ADAM,"Envenoms him that bears it!"
II,III,ORLANDO,"Why, what's the matter?"
II,III,ADAM,"O unhappy youth!"
II,III,ADAM,"Come not within these doors; within this roof"
II,III,ADAM,"The enemy of all your graces lives:"
II,III,ADAM,"Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--"
II,III,ADAM,"Yet not the son, I will not call him son"
II,III,ADAM,"Of him I was about to call his father--"
II,III,ADAM,"Hath heard your praises, and this night he means"
II,III,ADAM,"To burn the lodging where you use to lie"
II,III,ADAM,"And you within it: if he fail of that,"
II,III,ADAM,"He will have other means to cut you off."
II,III,ADAM,"I overheard him and his practises."
II,III,ADAM,"This is no place; this house is but a butchery:"
II,III,ADAM,"Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it."
II,III,ORLANDO,"Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?"
II,III,ADAM,"No matter whither, so you come not here."
II,III,ORLANDO,"What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?"
II,III,ORLANDO,"Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce"
II,III,ORLANDO,"A thievish living on the common road?"
II,III,ORLANDO,"This I must do, or know not what to do:"
II,III,ORLANDO,"Yet this I will not do, do how I can;"
II,III,ORLANDO,"I rather will subject me to the malice"
II,III,ORLANDO,"Of a diverted blood and bloody brother."
II,III,ADAM,"But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,"
II,III,ADAM,"The thrifty hire I saved under your father,"
II,III,ADAM,"Which I did store to be my foster-nurse"
II,III,ADAM,"When service should in my old limbs lie lame"
II,III,ADAM,"And unregarded age in corners thrown:"
II,III,ADAM,"Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,"
II,III,ADAM,"Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,"
II,III,ADAM,"Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;"
II,III,ADAM,"And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:"
II,III,ADAM,"Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;"
II,III,ADAM,"For in my youth I never did apply"
II,III,ADAM,"Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,"
II,III,ADAM,"Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo"
II,III,ADAM,"The means of weakness and debility;"
II,III,ADAM,"Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,"
II,III,ADAM,"Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;"
II,III,ADAM,"I'll do the service of a younger man"
II,III,ADAM,"In all your business and necessities."
II,III,ORLANDO,"O good old man, how well in thee appears"
II,III,ORLANDO,"The constant service of the antique world,"
II,III,ORLANDO,"When service sweat for duty, not for meed!"
II,III,ORLANDO,"Thou art not for the fashion of these times,"
II,III,ORLANDO,"Where none will sweat but for promotion,"
II,III,ORLANDO,"And having that, do choke their service up"
II,III,ORLANDO,"Even with the having: it is not so with thee."
II,III,ORLANDO,"But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,"
II,III,ORLANDO,"That cannot so much as a blossom yield"
II,III,ORLANDO,"In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry"
II,III,ORLANDO,"But come thy ways; well go along together,"
II,III,ORLANDO,"And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,"
II,III,ORLANDO,"We'll light upon some settled low content."
II,III,ADAM,"Master, go on, and I will follow thee,"
II,III,ADAM,"To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty."
II,III,ADAM,"From seventeen years till now almost fourscore"
II,III,ADAM,"Here lived I, but now live here no more."
II,III,ADAM,"At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;"
II,III,ADAM,"But at fourscore it is too late a week:"
II,III,ADAM,"Yet fortune cannot recompense me better"
II,III,ADAM,"Than to die well and not my master's debtor."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"good Aliena!"
II,IV,CELIA,"I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further."
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"for I think you have no money in your purse."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Well, this is the forest of Arden."
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"at home, I was in a better place: but travellers"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"must be content."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Ay, be so, good Touchstone."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"solemn talk."
II,IV,CORIN,"That is the way to make her scorn you still."
II,IV,SILVIUS,"O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!"
II,IV,CORIN,"I partly guess; for I have loved ere now."
II,IV,SILVIUS,"No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"But if thy love were ever like to mine--"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"As sure I think did never man love so--"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"How many actions most ridiculous"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?"
II,IV,CORIN,"Into a thousand that I have forgotten."
II,IV,SILVIUS,"O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"If thou remember'st not the slightest folly"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"That ever love did make thee run into,"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Thou hast not loved:"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Thou hast not loved:"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Or if thou hast not broke from company"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,"
II,IV,SILVIUS,"Thou hast not loved."
II,IV,SILVIUS,"O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"I have by hard adventure found mine own."
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"two cods and, giving her them again, said with"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of."
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"break my shins against it."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Is much upon my fashion."
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"And mine; but it grows something stale with me."
II,IV,CELIA,"I pray you, one of you question yond man"
II,IV,CELIA,"If he for gold will give us any food:"
II,IV,CELIA,"I faint almost to death."
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Holla, you clown!"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman."
II,IV,CORIN,"Who calls?"
II,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Your betters, sir."
II,IV,CORIN,"Else are they very wretched."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend."
II,IV,CORIN,"And to you, gentle sir, and to you all."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Can in this desert place buy entertainment,"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"And faints for succor."
II,IV,CORIN,"Fair sir, I pity her"
II,IV,CORIN,"And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,"
II,IV,CORIN,"My fortunes were more able to relieve her;"
II,IV,CORIN,"But I am shepherd to another man"
II,IV,CORIN,"And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:"
II,IV,CORIN,"My master is of churlish disposition"
II,IV,CORIN,"And little recks to find the way to heaven"
II,IV,CORIN,"By doing deeds of hospitality:"
II,IV,CORIN,"Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed"
II,IV,CORIN,"Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,"
II,IV,CORIN,"By reason of his absence, there is nothing"
II,IV,CORIN,"That you will feed on; but what is, come see."
II,IV,CORIN,"And in my voice most welcome shall you be."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?"
II,IV,CORIN,"That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,"
II,IV,CORIN,"That little cares for buying any thing."
II,IV,ROSALIND,"I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,"
II,IV,ROSALIND,"And thou shalt have to pay for it of us."
II,IV,CELIA,"And we will mend thy wages. I like this place."
II,IV,CELIA,"And willingly could waste my time in it."
II,IV,CORIN,"Assuredly the thing is to be sold:"
II,IV,CORIN,"Go with me: if you like upon report"
II,IV,CORIN,"The soil, the profit and this kind of life,"
II,IV,CORIN,"I will your very faithful feeder be"
II,IV,CORIN,"And buy it with your gold right suddenly."
II,V,AMIENS,"Under the greenwood tree"
II,V,AMIENS,"Who loves to lie with me,"
II,V,AMIENS,"And turn his merry note"
II,V,AMIENS,"Unto the sweet bird's throat,"
II,V,AMIENS,"Come hither, come hither, come hither:"
II,V,AMIENS,"Here shall he see No enemy"
II,V,AMIENS,"But winter and rough weather."
II,V,JAQUES,"More, more, I prithee, more."
II,V,AMIENS,"It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques."
II,V,JAQUES,"I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck"
II,V,JAQUES,"melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs."
II,V,JAQUES,"More, I prithee, more."
II,V,AMIENS,"My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you."
II,V,JAQUES,"I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to"
II,V,JAQUES,"sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?"
II,V,AMIENS,"What you will, Monsieur Jaques."
II,V,JAQUES,"Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me"
II,V,JAQUES,"nothing. Will you sing?"
II,V,AMIENS,"More at your request than to please myself."
II,V,JAQUES,"Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;"
II,V,JAQUES,"but that they call compliment is like the encounter"
II,V,JAQUES,"of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,"
II,V,JAQUES,"methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me"
II,V,JAQUES,"the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will"
II,V,JAQUES,"not, hold your tongues."
II,V,AMIENS,"Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the"
II,V,AMIENS,"duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all"
II,V,AMIENS,"this day to look you."
II,V,JAQUES,"And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is"
II,V,JAQUES,"too disputable for my company: I think of as many"
II,V,JAQUES,"matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no"
II,V,JAQUES,"boast of them. Come, warble, come."
II,V,JAQUES,"Who doth ambition shun"
II,V,JAQUES,"And loves to live i' the sun,"
II,V,JAQUES,"Seeking the food he eats"
II,V,JAQUES,"And pleased with what he gets,"
II,V,JAQUES,"Come hither, come hither, come hither:"
II,V,JAQUES,"Here shall he see No enemy"
II,V,JAQUES,"But winter and rough weather."
II,V,JAQUES,"I'll give you a verse to this note that I made"
II,V,JAQUES,"yesterday in despite of my invention."
II,V,AMIENS,"And I'll sing it."
II,V,JAQUES,"Thus it goes:--"
II,V,JAQUES,"If it do come to pass"
II,V,JAQUES,"That any man turn ass,"
II,V,JAQUES,"Leaving his wealth and ease,"
II,V,JAQUES,"A stubborn will to please,"
II,V,JAQUES,"Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:"
II,V,JAQUES,"Here shall he see"
II,V,JAQUES,"Gross fools as he,"
II,V,JAQUES,"An if he will come to me."
II,V,AMIENS,"What's that 'ducdame'?"
II,V,JAQUES,"'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a"
II,V,JAQUES,"circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll"
II,V,JAQUES,"rail against all the first-born of Egypt."
II,V,AMIENS,"And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared."
II,VI,ADAM,"Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!"
II,VI,ADAM,"Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,"
II,VI,ADAM,"kind master."
II,VI,ORLANDO,"Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little."
II,VI,ORLANDO,"If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"will either be food for it or bring it for food to"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers."
II,VI,ORLANDO,"For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly."
II,VI,ORLANDO,"Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this"
II,VI,ORLANDO,"desert. Cheerly, good Adam!"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"I think he be transform'd into a beast;"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"For I can no where find him like a man."
II,VII,First Lord,"My lord, he is but even now gone hence:"
II,VII,First Lord,"Here was he merry, hearing of a song."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"If he, compact of jars, grow musical,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"We shall have shortly discord in the spheres."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him."
II,VII,First Lord,"He saves my labour by his own approach."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"That your poor friends must woo your company?"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"What, you look merrily!"
II,VII,JAQUES,"A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"A motley fool; a miserable world!"
II,VII,JAQUES,"As I do live by food, I met a fool"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"In good set terms and yet a motley fool."
II,VII,JAQUES,"'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And then he drew a dial from his poke,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:"
II,VII,JAQUES,"'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear"
II,VII,JAQUES,"The motley fool thus moral on the time,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"That fools should be so deep-contemplative,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And I did laugh sans intermission"
II,VII,JAQUES,"An hour by his dial. O noble fool!"
II,VII,JAQUES,"A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"What fool is this?"
II,VII,JAQUES,"O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And says, if ladies be but young and fair,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit"
II,VII,JAQUES,"After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd"
II,VII,JAQUES,"With observation, the which he vents"
II,VII,JAQUES,"In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!"
II,VII,JAQUES,"I am ambitious for a motley coat."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Thou shalt have one."
II,VII,JAQUES,"It is my only suit;"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Provided that you weed your better judgments"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Of all opinion that grows rank in them"
II,VII,JAQUES,"That I am wise. I must have liberty"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Withal, as large a charter as the wind,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And they that are most galled with my folly,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?"
II,VII,JAQUES,"The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:"
II,VII,JAQUES,"He that a fool doth very wisely hit"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Doth very foolishly, although he smart,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"The wise man's folly is anatomized"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Even by the squandering glances of the fool."
II,VII,JAQUES,"Invest me in my motley; give me leave"
II,VII,JAQUES,"To speak my mind, and I will through and through"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"If they will patiently receive my medicine."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do."
II,VII,JAQUES,"What, for a counter, would I do but good?"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"For thou thyself hast been a libertine,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"As sensual as the brutish sting itself;"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And all the embossed sores and headed evils,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world."
II,VII,JAQUES,"Why, who cries out on pride,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"That can therein tax any private party?"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Till that the weary very means do ebb?"
II,VII,JAQUES,"What woman in the city do I name,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"When that I say the city-woman bears"
II,VII,JAQUES,"The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Who can come in and say that I mean her,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"When such a one as she such is her neighbour?"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Or what is he of basest function"
II,VII,JAQUES,"That says his bravery is not of my cost,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits"
II,VII,JAQUES,"His folly to the mettle of my speech?"
II,VII,JAQUES,"There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein"
II,VII,JAQUES,"My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Forbear, and eat no more."
II,VII,JAQUES,"Why, I have eat none yet."
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Nor shalt not, till necessity be served."
II,VII,JAQUES,"Of what kind should this cock come of?"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Or else a rude despiser of good manners,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"That in civility thou seem'st so empty?"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"He dies that touches any of this fruit"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Till I and my affairs are answered."
II,VII,JAQUES,"An you will not be answered with reason, I must die."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"What would you have? Your gentleness shall force"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"More than your force move us to gentleness."
II,VII,ORLANDO,"I almost die for food; and let me have it."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table."
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"I thought that all things had been savage here;"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"And therefore put I on the countenance"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"That in this desert inaccessible,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Under the shade of melancholy boughs,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"If ever you have look'd on better days,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"If ever sat at any good man's feast,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"True is it that we have seen better days,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And therefore sit you down in gentleness"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And take upon command what help we have"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"That to your wanting may be minister'd."
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Then but forbear your food a little while,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"And give it food. There is an old poor man,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Who after me hath many a weary step"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,"
II,VII,ORLANDO,"I will not touch a bit."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Go find him out,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And we will nothing waste till you return."
II,VII,ORLANDO,"I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"This wide and universal theatre"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Presents more woeful pageants than the scene"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Wherein we play in."
II,VII,JAQUES,"All the world's a stage,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And all the men and women merely players:"
II,VII,JAQUES,"They have their exits and their entrances;"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And one man in his time plays many parts,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms."
II,VII,JAQUES,"And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And shining morning face, creeping like snail"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Seeking the bubble reputation"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"In fair round belly with good capon lined,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Full of wise saws and modern instances;"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide"
II,VII,JAQUES,"For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Turning again toward childish treble, pipes"
II,VII,JAQUES,"And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"That ends this strange eventful history,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Is second childishness and mere oblivion,"
II,VII,JAQUES,"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And let him feed."
II,VII,ORLANDO,"I thank you most for him."
II,VII,ADAM,"So had you need:"
II,VII,ADAM,"I scarce can speak to thank you for myself."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"As yet, to question you about your fortunes."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing."
II,VII,AMIENS,"Blow, blow, thou winter wind."
II,VII,AMIENS,"Thou art not so unkind"
II,VII,AMIENS,"As man's ingratitude;"
II,VII,AMIENS,"Thy tooth is not so keen,"
II,VII,AMIENS,"Because thou art not seen,"
II,VII,AMIENS,"Although thy breath be rude."
II,VII,AMIENS,"Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:"
II,VII,AMIENS,"Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:"
II,VII,AMIENS,"Then, heigh-ho, the holly!"
II,VII,AMIENS,"This life is most jolly."
II,VII,AMIENS,"Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,"
II,VII,AMIENS,"That dost not bite so nigh"
II,VII,AMIENS,"As benefits forgot:"
II,VII,AMIENS,"Though thou the waters warp,"
II,VII,AMIENS,"Thy sting is not so sharp"
II,VII,AMIENS,"As friend remember'd not."
II,VII,AMIENS,"Heigh-ho! sing, &c."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And as mine eye doth his effigies witness"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Most truly limn'd and living in your face,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Thou art right welcome as thy master is."
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,"
II,VII,DUKE SENIOR,"And let me all your fortunes understand."
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"But were I not the better part made mercy,"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"I should not seek an absent argument"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"To seek a living in our territory."
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Of what we think against thee."
III,I,OLIVER,"O that your highness knew my heart in this!"
III,I,OLIVER,"I never loved my brother in my life."
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"And let my officers of such a nature"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Make an extent upon his house and lands:"
III,I,DUKE FREDERICK,"Do this expediently and turn him going."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:"
III,II,ORLANDO,"And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey"
III,II,ORLANDO,"With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway."
III,II,ORLANDO,"O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books"
III,II,ORLANDO,"And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;"
III,II,ORLANDO,"That every eye which in this forest looks"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree"
III,II,ORLANDO,"The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she."
III,II,CORIN,"And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"like it very well; but in respect that it is"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?"
III,II,CORIN,"No more but that I know the more one sickens the"
III,II,CORIN,"worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,"
III,II,CORIN,"means and content is without three good friends;"
III,II,CORIN,"that the property of rain is to wet and fire to"
III,II,CORIN,"burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a"
III,II,CORIN,"great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that"
III,II,CORIN,"he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may"
III,II,CORIN,"complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"court, shepherd?"
III,II,CORIN,"No, truly."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Then thou art damned."
III,II,CORIN,"Nay, I hope."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"on one side."
III,II,CORIN,"For not being at court? Your reason."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"state, shepherd."
III,II,CORIN,"Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners"
III,II,CORIN,"at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the"
III,II,CORIN,"behavior of the country is most mockable at the"
III,II,CORIN,"court. You told me you salute not at the court, but"
III,II,CORIN,"you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be"
III,II,CORIN,"uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Instance, briefly; come, instance."
III,II,CORIN,"Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their"
III,II,CORIN,"fells, you know, are greasy."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come."
III,II,CORIN,"Besides, our hands are hard."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"A more sounder instance, come."
III,II,CORIN,"And they are often tarred over with the surgery of"
III,II,CORIN,"our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The"
III,II,CORIN,"courtier's hands are perfumed with civet."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd."
III,II,CORIN,"You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"God make incision in thee! thou art raw."
III,II,CORIN,"Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get"
III,II,CORIN,"that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's"
III,II,CORIN,"happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my"
III,II,CORIN,"harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes"
III,II,CORIN,"graze and my lambs suck."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"and the rams together and to offer to get your"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"damned for this, the devil himself will have no"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"'scape."
III,II,CORIN,"Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother."
III,II,ROSALIND,"From the east to western Ind,"
III,II,ROSALIND,"No jewel is like Rosalind."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Her worth, being mounted on the wind,"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Through all the world bears Rosalind."
III,II,ROSALIND,"All the pictures fairest lined"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Are but black to Rosalind."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Let no fair be kept in mind"
III,II,ROSALIND,"But the fair of Rosalind."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"right butter-women's rank to market."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Out, fool!"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"For a taste:"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"If a hart do lack a hind,"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Let him seek out Rosalind."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"If the cat will after kind,"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"So be sure will Rosalind."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Winter garments must be lined,"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"So must slender Rosalind."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"They that reap must sheaf and bind;"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Then to cart with Rosalind."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Such a nut is Rosalind."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"He that sweetest rose will find"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Must find love's prick and Rosalind."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"infect yourself with them?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Truly, the tree yields bad fruit."
III,II,ROSALIND,"I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it"
III,II,ROSALIND,"with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit"
III,II,ROSALIND,"i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half"
III,II,ROSALIND,"ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"forest judge."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside."
III,II,CELIA,"Why should this a desert be?"
III,II,CELIA,"For it is unpeopled? No:"
III,II,CELIA,"Tongues I'll hang on every tree,"
III,II,CELIA,"That shall civil sayings show:"
III,II,CELIA,"Some, how brief the life of man"
III,II,CELIA,"Runs his erring pilgrimage,"
III,II,CELIA,"That the stretching of a span"
III,II,CELIA,"Buckles in his sum of age;"
III,II,CELIA,"Some, of violated vows"
III,II,CELIA,"'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:"
III,II,CELIA,"But upon the fairest boughs,"
III,II,CELIA,"Or at every sentence end,"
III,II,CELIA,"Will I Rosalinda write,"
III,II,CELIA,"Teaching all that read to know"
III,II,CELIA,"The quintessence of every sprite"
III,II,CELIA,"Heaven would in little show."
III,II,CELIA,"Therefore Heaven Nature charged"
III,II,CELIA,"That one body should be fill'd"
III,II,CELIA,"With all graces wide-enlarged:"
III,II,CELIA,"Nature presently distill'd"
III,II,CELIA,"Helen's cheek, but not her heart,"
III,II,CELIA,"Cleopatra's majesty,"
III,II,CELIA,"Atalanta's better part,"
III,II,CELIA,"Sad Lucretia's modesty."
III,II,CELIA,"Thus Rosalind of many parts"
III,II,CELIA,"By heavenly synod was devised,"
III,II,CELIA,"Of many faces, eyes and hearts,"
III,II,CELIA,"To have the touches dearest prized."
III,II,CELIA,"Heaven would that she these gifts should have,"
III,II,CELIA,"And I to live and die her slave."
III,II,ROSALIND,"O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love"
III,II,ROSALIND,"have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never"
III,II,ROSALIND,"cried 'Have patience, good people!'"
III,II,CELIA,"How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little."
III,II,CELIA,"Go with him, sirrah."
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;"
III,II,TOUCHSTONE,"though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage."
III,II,CELIA,"Didst thou hear these verses?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of"
III,II,ROSALIND,"them had in them more feet than the verses would bear."
III,II,CELIA,"That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear"
III,II,ROSALIND,"themselves without the verse and therefore stood"
III,II,ROSALIND,"lamely in the verse."
III,II,CELIA,"But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name"
III,II,CELIA,"should be hanged and carved upon these trees?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder"
III,II,ROSALIND,"before you came; for look here what I found on a"
III,II,ROSALIND,"palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I"
III,II,ROSALIND,"can hardly remember."
III,II,CELIA,"Trow you who hath done this?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Is it a man?"
III,II,CELIA,"And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck."
III,II,CELIA,"Change you colour?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"I prithee, who?"
III,II,CELIA,"O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to"
III,II,CELIA,"meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes"
III,II,CELIA,"and so encounter."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Nay, but who is it?"
III,II,CELIA,"Is it possible?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,"
III,II,ROSALIND,"tell me who it is."
III,II,CELIA,"O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful"
III,II,CELIA,"wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,"
III,II,CELIA,"out of all hooping!"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am"
III,II,ROSALIND,"caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in"
III,II,ROSALIND,"my disposition? One inch of delay more is a"
III,II,ROSALIND,"South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it"
III,II,ROSALIND,"quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst"
III,II,ROSALIND,"stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man"
III,II,ROSALIND,"out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-"
III,II,ROSALIND,"mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at"
III,II,ROSALIND,"all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that"
III,II,ROSALIND,"may drink thy tidings."
III,II,CELIA,"So you may put a man in your belly."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his"
III,II,ROSALIND,"head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?"
III,II,CELIA,"Nay, he hath but a little beard."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Why, God will send more, if the man will be"
III,II,ROSALIND,"thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if"
III,II,ROSALIND,"thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin."
III,II,CELIA,"It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's"
III,II,CELIA,"heels and your heart both in an instant."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and"
III,II,ROSALIND,"true maid."
III,II,CELIA,"I' faith, coz, 'tis he."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Orlando?"
III,II,CELIA,"Orlando."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and"
III,II,ROSALIND,"hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said"
III,II,ROSALIND,"he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes"
III,II,ROSALIND,"him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see"
III,II,ROSALIND,"him again? Answer me in one word."
III,II,CELIA,"You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a"
III,II,CELIA,"word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To"
III,II,CELIA,"say ay and no to these particulars is more than to"
III,II,CELIA,"answer in a catechism."
III,II,ROSALIND,"But doth he know that I am in this forest and in"
III,II,ROSALIND,"man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the"
III,II,ROSALIND,"day he wrestled?"
III,II,CELIA,"It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the"
III,II,CELIA,"propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my"
III,II,CELIA,"finding him, and relish it with good observance."
III,II,CELIA,"I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn."
III,II,ROSALIND,"It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops"
III,II,ROSALIND,"forth such fruit."
III,II,CELIA,"Give me audience, good madam."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Proceed."
III,II,CELIA,"There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well"
III,II,ROSALIND,"becomes the ground."
III,II,CELIA,"Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets"
III,II,CELIA,"unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter."
III,II,ROSALIND,"O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart."
III,II,CELIA,"I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest"
III,II,CELIA,"me out of tune."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must"
III,II,ROSALIND,"speak. Sweet, say on."
III,II,CELIA,"You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"'Tis he: slink by, and note him."
III,II,JAQUES,"I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had"
III,II,JAQUES,"as lief have been myself alone."
III,II,ORLANDO,"And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you"
III,II,ORLANDO,"too for your society."
III,II,JAQUES,"God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I do desire we may be better strangers."
III,II,JAQUES,"I pray you, mar no more trees with writing"
III,II,JAQUES,"love-songs in their barks."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading"
III,II,ORLANDO,"them ill-favouredly."
III,II,JAQUES,"Rosalind is your love's name?"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Yes, just."
III,II,JAQUES,"I do not like her name."
III,II,ORLANDO,"There was no thought of pleasing you when she was"
III,II,ORLANDO,"christened."
III,II,JAQUES,"What stature is she of?"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Just as high as my heart."
III,II,JAQUES,"You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been"
III,II,JAQUES,"acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them"
III,II,JAQUES,"out of rings?"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from"
III,II,ORLANDO,"whence you have studied your questions."
III,II,JAQUES,"You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of"
III,II,JAQUES,"Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and"
III,II,JAQUES,"we two will rail against our mistress the world and"
III,II,JAQUES,"all our misery."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I will chide no breather in the world but myself,"
III,II,ORLANDO,"against whom I know most faults."
III,II,JAQUES,"The worst fault you have is to be in love."
III,II,ORLANDO,"'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I am weary of you."
III,II,JAQUES,"By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found"
III,II,JAQUES,"you."
III,II,ORLANDO,"He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you"
III,II,ORLANDO,"shall see him."
III,II,JAQUES,"There I shall see mine own figure."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher."
III,II,JAQUES,"I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good"
III,II,JAQUES,"Signior Love."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Melancholy."
III,II,ROSALIND,"lackey and under that habit play the knave with him."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Do you hear, forester?"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Very well: what would you?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"I pray you, what is't o'clock?"
III,II,ORLANDO,"You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock"
III,II,ORLANDO,"in the forest."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Then there is no true lover in the forest; else"
III,II,ROSALIND,"sighing every minute and groaning every hour would"
III,II,ROSALIND,"detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock."
III,II,ORLANDO,"And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that"
III,II,ORLANDO,"been as proper?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with"
III,II,ROSALIND,"divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles"
III,II,ROSALIND,"withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops"
III,II,ROSALIND,"withal and who he stands still withal."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I prithee, who doth he trot withal?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the"
III,II,ROSALIND,"contract of her marriage and the day it is"
III,II,ROSALIND,"solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of"
III,II,ROSALIND,"seven year."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Who ambles Time withal?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that"
III,II,ROSALIND,"hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because"
III,II,ROSALIND,"he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because"
III,II,ROSALIND,"he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean"
III,II,ROSALIND,"and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden"
III,II,ROSALIND,"of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Who doth he gallop withal?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as"
III,II,ROSALIND,"softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Who stays it still withal?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between"
III,II,ROSALIND,"term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Where dwell you, pretty youth?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the"
III,II,ROSALIND,"skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Are you native of this place?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Your accent is something finer than you could"
III,II,ORLANDO,"purchase in so removed a dwelling."
III,II,ROSALIND,"I have been told so of many: but indeed an old"
III,II,ROSALIND,"religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was"
III,II,ROSALIND,"in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship"
III,II,ROSALIND,"too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard"
III,II,ROSALIND,"him read many lectures against it, and I thank God"
III,II,ROSALIND,"I am not a woman, to be touched with so many"
III,II,ROSALIND,"giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their"
III,II,ROSALIND,"whole sex withal."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Can you remember any of the principal evils that he"
III,II,ORLANDO,"laid to the charge of women?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"There were none principal; they were all like one"
III,II,ROSALIND,"another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming"
III,II,ROSALIND,"monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I prithee, recount some of them."
III,II,ROSALIND,"No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that"
III,II,ROSALIND,"are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that"
III,II,ROSALIND,"abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on"
III,II,ROSALIND,"their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies"
III,II,ROSALIND,"on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would"
III,II,ROSALIND,"give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the"
III,II,ROSALIND,"quotidian of love upon him."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me"
III,II,ORLANDO,"your remedy."
III,II,ROSALIND,"There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he"
III,II,ROSALIND,"taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage"
III,II,ROSALIND,"of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner."
III,II,ORLANDO,"What were his marks?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and"
III,II,ROSALIND,"sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable"
III,II,ROSALIND,"spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,"
III,II,ROSALIND,"which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for"
III,II,ROSALIND,"simply your having in beard is a younger brother's"
III,II,ROSALIND,"revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your"
III,II,ROSALIND,"bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe"
III,II,ROSALIND,"untied and every thing about you demonstrating a"
III,II,ROSALIND,"careless desolation; but you are no such man; you"
III,II,ROSALIND,"are rather point-device in your accoutrements as"
III,II,ROSALIND,"loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you"
III,II,ROSALIND,"love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to"
III,II,ROSALIND,"do than to confess she does: that is one of the"
III,II,ROSALIND,"points in the which women still give the lie to"
III,II,ROSALIND,"their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he"
III,II,ROSALIND,"that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind"
III,II,ROSALIND,"is so admired?"
III,II,ORLANDO,"I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he."
III,II,ROSALIND,"But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?"
III,II,ORLANDO,"Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves"
III,II,ROSALIND,"as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and"
III,II,ROSALIND,"the reason why they are not so punished and cured"
III,II,ROSALIND,"is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers"
III,II,ROSALIND,"are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Did you ever cure any so?"
III,II,ROSALIND,"Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me"
III,II,ROSALIND,"his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to"
III,II,ROSALIND,"woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish"
III,II,ROSALIND,"youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing"
III,II,ROSALIND,"and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,"
III,II,ROSALIND,"inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every"
III,II,ROSALIND,"passion something and for no passion truly any"
III,II,ROSALIND,"thing, as boys and women are for the most part"
III,II,ROSALIND,"cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe"
III,II,ROSALIND,"him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep"
III,II,ROSALIND,"for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor"
III,II,ROSALIND,"from his mad humour of love to a living humour of"
III,II,ROSALIND,"madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of"
III,II,ROSALIND,"the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic."
III,II,ROSALIND,"And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon"
III,II,ROSALIND,"me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's"
III,II,ROSALIND,"heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't."
III,II,ORLANDO,"I would not be cured, youth."
III,II,ROSALIND,"I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind"
III,II,ROSALIND,"and come every day to my cote and woo me."
III,II,ORLANDO,"Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me"
III,II,ORLANDO,"where it is."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way"
III,II,ROSALIND,"you shall tell me where in the forest you live."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Will you go?"
III,II,ORLANDO,"With all my heart, good youth."
III,II,ROSALIND,"Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"doth my simple feature content you?"
III,III,AUDREY,"Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths."
III,III,JAQUES,"in a thatched house!"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"man's good wit seconded with the forward child"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"the gods had made thee poetical."
III,III,AUDREY,"I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in"
III,III,AUDREY,"deed and word? is it a true thing?"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign."
III,III,AUDREY,"Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"hope thou didst feign."
III,III,AUDREY,"Would you not have me honest?"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar."
III,III,AUDREY,"Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods"
III,III,AUDREY,"make me honest."
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"were to put good meat into an unclean dish."
III,III,AUDREY,"I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul."
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"village, who hath promised to meet me in this place"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"of the forest and to couple us."
III,III,AUDREY,"Well, the gods give us joy!"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"married man more honourable than the bare brow of a"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"want. Here comes Sir Oliver."
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"with you to your chapel?"
III,III,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,"Is there none here to give the woman?"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"I will not take her on gift of any man."
III,III,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,"Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful."
III,III,JAQUES,"Proceed, proceed I'll give her."
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"last company: I am very glad to see you: even a"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered."
III,III,JAQUES,"Will you be married, motley?"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling."
III,III,JAQUES,"And will you, being a man of your breeding, be"
III,III,JAQUES,"married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to"
III,III,JAQUES,"church, and have a good priest that can tell you"
III,III,JAQUES,"what marriage is: this fellow will but join you"
III,III,JAQUES,"together as they join wainscot; then one of you will"
III,III,JAQUES,"prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp."
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"married of him than of another: for he is not like"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"to marry me well; and not being well married, it"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife."
III,III,JAQUES,"Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee."
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"'Come, sweet Audrey:"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"We must be married, or we must live in bawdry."
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"O sweet Oliver,"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"O brave Oliver,"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Leave me not behind thee: but,--"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Wind away,"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Begone, I say,"
III,III,TOUCHSTONE,"I will not to wedding with thee."
III,III,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,"'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them"
III,III,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,"all shall flout me out of my calling."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"Never talk to me; I will weep."
III,IV,CELIA,"Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider"
III,IV,CELIA,"that tears do not become a man."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"But have I not cause to weep?"
III,IV,CELIA,"As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"His very hair is of the dissembling colour."
III,IV,CELIA,"Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are"
III,IV,CELIA,"Judas's own children."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"I' faith, his hair is of a good colour."
III,IV,CELIA,"An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch"
III,IV,ROSALIND,"of holy bread."
III,IV,CELIA,"He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun"
III,IV,CELIA,"of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;"
III,IV,CELIA,"the very ice of chastity is in them."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"But why did he swear he would come this morning, and"
III,IV,ROSALIND,"comes not?"
III,IV,CELIA,"Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"Do you think so?"
III,IV,CELIA,"Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a"
III,IV,CELIA,"horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do"
III,IV,CELIA,"think him as concave as a covered goblet or a"
III,IV,CELIA,"worm-eaten nut."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"Not true in love?"
III,IV,CELIA,"Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"You have heard him swear downright he was."
III,IV,CELIA,"'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is"
III,IV,CELIA,"no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are"
III,IV,CELIA,"both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends"
III,IV,CELIA,"here in the forest on the duke your father."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"I met the duke yesterday and had much question with"
III,IV,ROSALIND,"him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told"
III,IV,ROSALIND,"him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a"
III,IV,ROSALIND,"man as Orlando?"
III,IV,CELIA,"O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,"
III,IV,CELIA,"speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks"
III,IV,CELIA,"them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of"
III,IV,CELIA,"his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse"
III,IV,CELIA,"but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble"
III,IV,CELIA,"goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly"
III,IV,CELIA,"guides. Who comes here?"
III,IV,CORIN,"Mistress and master, you have oft inquired"
III,IV,CORIN,"After the shepherd that complain'd of love,"
III,IV,CORIN,"Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,"
III,IV,CORIN,"Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess"
III,IV,CORIN,"That was his mistress."
III,IV,CELIA,"Well, and what of him?"
III,IV,CORIN,"If you will see a pageant truly play'd,"
III,IV,CORIN,"Between the pale complexion of true love"
III,IV,CORIN,"And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,"
III,IV,CORIN,"Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,"
III,IV,CORIN,"If you will mark it."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"O, come, let us remove:"
III,IV,ROSALIND,"The sight of lovers feedeth those in love."
III,IV,ROSALIND,"Bring us to this sight, and you shall say"
III,IV,ROSALIND,"I'll prove a busy actor in their play."
III,V,SILVIUS,"Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Say that you love me not, but say not so"
III,V,SILVIUS,"In bitterness. The common executioner,"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck"
III,V,SILVIUS,"But first begs pardon: will you sterner be"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?"
III,V,PHEBE,"I would not be thy executioner:"
III,V,PHEBE,"I fly thee, for I would not injure thee."
III,V,PHEBE,"Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:"
III,V,PHEBE,"'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,"
III,V,PHEBE,"That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,"
III,V,PHEBE,"Who shut their coward gates on atomies,"
III,V,PHEBE,"Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!"
III,V,PHEBE,"Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;"
III,V,PHEBE,"And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:"
III,V,PHEBE,"Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;"
III,V,PHEBE,"Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,"
III,V,PHEBE,"Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!"
III,V,PHEBE,"Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:"
III,V,PHEBE,"Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains"
III,V,PHEBE,"Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,"
III,V,PHEBE,"The cicatrice and capable impressure"
III,V,PHEBE,"Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,"
III,V,PHEBE,"Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,"
III,V,PHEBE,"Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes"
III,V,PHEBE,"That can do hurt."
III,V,SILVIUS,"O dear Phebe,"
III,V,SILVIUS,"If ever,--as that ever may be near,--"
III,V,SILVIUS,"You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Then shall you know the wounds invisible"
III,V,SILVIUS,"That love's keen arrows make."
III,V,PHEBE,"But till that time"
III,V,PHEBE,"Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,"
III,V,PHEBE,"Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;"
III,V,PHEBE,"As till that time I shall not pity thee."
III,V,ROSALIND,"And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"That you insult, exult, and all at once,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--"
III,V,ROSALIND,"As, by my faith, I see no more in you"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Than without candle may go dark to bed--"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?"
III,V,ROSALIND,"I see no more in you than in the ordinary"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"I think she means to tangle my eyes too!"
III,V,ROSALIND,"No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:"
III,V,ROSALIND,"'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"That can entame my spirits to your worship."
III,V,ROSALIND,"You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?"
III,V,ROSALIND,"You are a thousand times a properer man"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you"
III,V,ROSALIND,"That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:"
III,V,ROSALIND,"'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;"
III,V,ROSALIND,"And out of you she sees herself more proper"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Than any of her lineaments can show her."
III,V,ROSALIND,"But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:"
III,V,ROSALIND,"For I must tell you friendly in your ear,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer."
III,V,ROSALIND,"So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well."
III,V,PHEBE,"Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:"
III,V,PHEBE,"I had rather hear you chide than this man woo."
III,V,ROSALIND,"He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll"
III,V,ROSALIND,"fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as"
III,V,ROSALIND,"she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her"
III,V,ROSALIND,"with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?"
III,V,PHEBE,"For no ill will I bear you."
III,V,ROSALIND,"I pray you, do not fall in love with me,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"For I am falser than vows made in wine:"
III,V,ROSALIND,"Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by."
III,V,ROSALIND,"Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard."
III,V,ROSALIND,"Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"And be not proud: though all the world could see,"
III,V,ROSALIND,"None could be so abused in sight as he."
III,V,ROSALIND,"Come, to our flock."
III,V,PHEBE,"Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,"
III,V,PHEBE,"'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Sweet Phebe,--"
III,V,PHEBE,"Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Sweet Phebe, pity me."
III,V,PHEBE,"Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius."
III,V,SILVIUS,"Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:"
III,V,SILVIUS,"If you do sorrow at my grief in love,"
III,V,SILVIUS,"By giving love your sorrow and my grief"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Were both extermined."
III,V,PHEBE,"Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?"
III,V,SILVIUS,"I would have you."
III,V,PHEBE,"Why, that were covetousness."
III,V,PHEBE,"Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,"
III,V,PHEBE,"And yet it is not that I bear thee love;"
III,V,PHEBE,"But since that thou canst talk of love so well,"
III,V,PHEBE,"Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,"
III,V,PHEBE,"I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:"
III,V,PHEBE,"But do not look for further recompense"
III,V,PHEBE,"Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd."
III,V,SILVIUS,"So holy and so perfect is my love,"
III,V,SILVIUS,"And I in such a poverty of grace,"
III,V,SILVIUS,"That I shall think it a most plenteous crop"
III,V,SILVIUS,"To glean the broken ears after the man"
III,V,SILVIUS,"That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then"
III,V,SILVIUS,"A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon."
III,V,PHEBE,"Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Not very well, but I have met him oft;"
III,V,SILVIUS,"And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds"
III,V,SILVIUS,"That the old carlot once was master of."
III,V,PHEBE,"Think not I love him, though I ask for him:"
III,V,PHEBE,"'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;"
III,V,PHEBE,"But what care I for words? yet words do well"
III,V,PHEBE,"When he that speaks them pleases those that hear."
III,V,PHEBE,"It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:"
III,V,PHEBE,"But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:"
III,V,PHEBE,"He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him"
III,V,PHEBE,"Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue"
III,V,PHEBE,"Did make offence his eye did heal it up."
III,V,PHEBE,"He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:"
III,V,PHEBE,"His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:"
III,V,PHEBE,"There was a pretty redness in his lip,"
III,V,PHEBE,"A little riper and more lusty red"
III,V,PHEBE,"Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference"
III,V,PHEBE,"Between the constant red and mingled damask."
III,V,PHEBE,"There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him"
III,V,PHEBE,"In parcels as I did, would have gone near"
III,V,PHEBE,"To fall in love with him; but, for my part,"
III,V,PHEBE,"I love him not nor hate him not; and yet"
III,V,PHEBE,"I have more cause to hate him than to love him:"
III,V,PHEBE,"For what had he to do to chide at me?"
III,V,PHEBE,"He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:"
III,V,PHEBE,"And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:"
III,V,PHEBE,"I marvel why I answer'd not again:"
III,V,PHEBE,"But that's all one; omittance is no quittance."
III,V,PHEBE,"I'll write to him a very taunting letter,"
III,V,PHEBE,"And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?"
III,V,SILVIUS,"Phebe, with all my heart."
III,V,PHEBE,"I'll write it straight;"
III,V,PHEBE,"The matter's in my head and in my heart:"
III,V,PHEBE,"I will be bitter with him and passing short."
III,V,PHEBE,"Go with me, Silvius."
IV,I,JAQUES,"I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted"
IV,I,JAQUES,"with thee."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"They say you are a melancholy fellow."
IV,I,JAQUES,"I am so; I do love it better than laughing."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Those that are in extremity of either are abominable"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"fellows and betray themselves to every modern"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"censure worse than drunkards."
IV,I,JAQUES,"Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Why then, 'tis good to be a post."
IV,I,JAQUES,"I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is"
IV,I,JAQUES,"emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,"
IV,I,JAQUES,"nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the"
IV,I,JAQUES,"soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,"
IV,I,JAQUES,"which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor"
IV,I,JAQUES,"the lover's, which is all these: but it is a"
IV,I,JAQUES,"melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,"
IV,I,JAQUES,"extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's"
IV,I,JAQUES,"contemplation of my travels, in which my often"
IV,I,JAQUES,"rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"other men's; then, to have seen much and to have"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands."
IV,I,JAQUES,"Yes, I have gained my experience."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"a fool to make me merry than experience to make me"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"sad; and to travel for it too!"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!"
IV,I,JAQUES,"Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"own country, be out of love with your nativity and"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"almost chide God for making you that countenance you"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"another trick, never come in my sight more."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Break an hour's promise in love! He that will"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"him heart-whole."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Pardon me, dear Rosalind."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"had as lief be wooed of a snail."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Of a snail?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"carries his house on his head; a better jointure,"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"his destiny with him."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"What's that?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"And I am your Rosalind."
IV,I,CELIA,"It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a"
IV,I,CELIA,"Rosalind of a better leer than you."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"humour and like enough to consent. What would you"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"I would kiss before I spoke."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"gravelled for lack of matter, you might take"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"How if the kiss be denied?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"I should think my honesty ranker than my wit."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"What, of my suit?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Am not I your Rosalind?"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"I take some joy to say you are, because I would be"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"talking of her."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Well in her person I say I will not have you."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Then in mine own person I die."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"almost six thousand years old, and in all this time"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"there was not any man died in his own person,"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"could to die before, and he is one of the patterns"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"But these are all lies: men have died from time to"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"time and worms have eaten them, but not for love."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"for, I protest, her frown might kill me."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"it."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Then love me, Rosalind."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"And wilt thou have me?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Ay, and twenty such."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"What sayest thou?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Are you not good?"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"I hope so."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Pray thee, marry us."
IV,I,CELIA,"I cannot say the words."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'"
IV,I,CELIA,"Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"I will."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Ay, but when?"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Why now; as fast as she can marry us."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"I take thee, Rosalind, for wife."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"I might ask you for your commission; but I do take"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"runs before her actions."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"So do all thoughts; they are winged."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Now tell me how long you would have her after you"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"have possessed her."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"For ever and a day."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"men are April when they woo, December when they wed:"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"maids are May when they are maids, but the sky"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"in the fountain, and I will do that when you are"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"that when thou art inclined to sleep."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"But will my Rosalind do so?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"By my life, she will do as I do."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"O, but she is wise."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"with the smoke out at the chimney."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"'Wit, whither wilt?'"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"And what wit could wit have to excuse that?"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"never take her without her answer, unless you take"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"make her fault her husband's occasion, let her"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"never nurse her child herself, for she will breed"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"it like a fool!"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"will be with thee again."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"would prove: my friends told me as much, and I"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"death! Two o'clock is your hour?"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Ay, sweet Rosalind."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"if you break one jot of your promise or come one"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"minute behind your hour, I will think you the most"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"may be chosen out of the gross band of the"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"your promise."
IV,I,ORLANDO,"With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my"
IV,I,ORLANDO,"Rosalind: so adieu."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"offenders, and let Time try: adieu."
IV,I,CELIA,"You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:"
IV,I,CELIA,"we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your"
IV,I,CELIA,"head, and show the world what the bird hath done to"
IV,I,CELIA,"her own nest."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"bottom, like the bay of Portugal."
IV,I,CELIA,"Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour"
IV,I,CELIA,"affection in, it runs out."
IV,I,ROSALIND,"No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and"
IV,I,ROSALIND,"sigh till he come."
IV,I,CELIA,"And I'll sleep."
IV,II,JAQUES,"Which is he that killed the deer?"
IV,II,A Lord,"Sir, it was I."
IV,II,JAQUES,"Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman"
IV,II,JAQUES,"conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's"
IV,II,JAQUES,"horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have"
IV,II,JAQUES,"you no song, forester, for this purpose?"
IV,II,Forester,"Yes, sir."
IV,II,JAQUES,"Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it"
IV,II,JAQUES,"make noise enough."
IV,II,Forester,"What shall he have that kill'd the deer?"
IV,II,Forester,"His leather skin and horns to wear."
IV,II,Forester,"Then sing him home;"
IV,II,Forester,"Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;"
IV,II,Forester,"It was a crest ere thou wast born:"
IV,II,Forester,"Thy father's father wore it,"
IV,II,Forester,"And thy father bore it:"
IV,II,Forester,"The horn, the horn, the lusty horn"
IV,II,Forester,"Is not a thing to laugh to scorn."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"here much Orlando!"
IV,III,CELIA,"I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he"
IV,III,CELIA,"hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to"
IV,III,CELIA,"sleep. Look, who comes here."
IV,III,SILVIUS,"My errand is to you, fair youth;"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"I know not the contents; but, as I guess"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"By the stern brow and waspish action"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"Which she did use as she was writing of it,"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"I am but as a guiltless messenger."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Patience herself would startle at this letter"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"This is a letter of your own device."
IV,III,SILVIUS,"No, I protest, I know not the contents:"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"Phebe did write it."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Come, come, you are a fool"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"And turn'd into the extremity of love."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"I say she never did invent this letter;"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"This is a man's invention and his hand."
IV,III,SILVIUS,"Sure, it is hers."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"So please you, for I never heard it yet;"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Can a woman rail thus?"
IV,III,SILVIUS,"Call you this railing?"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Why, thy godhead laid apart,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Did you ever hear such railing?"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Whiles the eye of man did woo me,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"That could do no vengeance to me."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Meaning me a beast."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"If the scorn of your bright eyne"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Have power to raise such love in mine,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Alack, in me what strange effect"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Would they work in mild aspect!"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Whiles you chid me, I did love;"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"How then might your prayers move!"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"He that brings this love to thee"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Little knows this love in me:"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"And by him seal up thy mind;"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Whether that thy youth and kind"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Will the faithful offer take"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Of me and all that I can make;"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Or else by him my love deny,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"And then I'll study how to die."
IV,III,SILVIUS,"Call you this chiding?"
IV,III,CELIA,"Alas, poor shepherd!"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"her: that if she love me, I charge her to love"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"hence, and not a word; for here comes more company."
IV,III,OLIVER,"Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Where in the purlieus of this forest stands"
IV,III,OLIVER,"A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?"
IV,III,CELIA,"West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:"
IV,III,CELIA,"The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream"
IV,III,CELIA,"Left on your right hand brings you to the place."
IV,III,CELIA,"But at this hour the house doth keep itself;"
IV,III,CELIA,"There's none within."
IV,III,OLIVER,"If that an eye may profit by a tongue,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Then should I know you by description;"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Of female favour, and bestows himself"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Like a ripe sister: the woman low"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And browner than her brother.' Are not you"
IV,III,OLIVER,"The owner of the house I did inquire for?"
IV,III,CELIA,"It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are."
IV,III,OLIVER,"Orlando doth commend him to you both,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And to that youth he calls his Rosalind"
IV,III,OLIVER,"He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"I am: what must we understand by this?"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Some of my shame; if you will know of me"
IV,III,OLIVER,"What man I am, and how, and why, and where"
IV,III,OLIVER,"This handkercher was stain'd."
IV,III,CELIA,"I pray you, tell it."
IV,III,OLIVER,"When last the young Orlando parted from you"
IV,III,OLIVER,"He left a promise to return again"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And mark what object did present itself:"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And high top bald with dry antiquity,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck"
IV,III,OLIVER,"A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd"
IV,III,OLIVER,"The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And with indented glides did slip away"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Into a bush: under which bush's shade"
IV,III,OLIVER,"A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis"
IV,III,OLIVER,"The royal disposition of that beast"
IV,III,OLIVER,"To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:"
IV,III,OLIVER,"This seen, Orlando did approach the man"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And found it was his brother, his elder brother."
IV,III,CELIA,"O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;"
IV,III,CELIA,"And he did render him the most unnatural"
IV,III,CELIA,"That lived amongst men."
IV,III,OLIVER,"And well he might so do,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"For well I know he was unnatural."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;"
IV,III,OLIVER,"But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And nature, stronger than his just occasion,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Made him give battle to the lioness,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling"
IV,III,OLIVER,"From miserable slumber I awaked."
IV,III,CELIA,"Are you his brother?"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Wast you he rescued?"
IV,III,CELIA,"Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?"
IV,III,OLIVER,"'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame"
IV,III,OLIVER,"To tell you what I was, since my conversion"
IV,III,OLIVER,"So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"But, for the bloody napkin?"
IV,III,OLIVER,"By and by."
IV,III,OLIVER,"When from the first to last betwixt us two"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"As how I came into that desert place:--"
IV,III,OLIVER,"In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Committing me unto my brother's love;"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Who led me instantly unto his cave,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm"
IV,III,OLIVER,"The lioness had torn some flesh away,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind."
IV,III,OLIVER,"Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;"
IV,III,OLIVER,"And, after some small space, being strong at heart,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"He sent me hither, stranger as I am,"
IV,III,OLIVER,"To tell this story, that you might excuse"
IV,III,OLIVER,"His broken promise, and to give this napkin"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth"
IV,III,OLIVER,"That he in sport doth call his Rosalind."
IV,III,CELIA,"Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Many will swoon when they do look on blood."
IV,III,CELIA,"There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Look, he recovers."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"I would I were at home."
IV,III,CELIA,"We'll lead you thither."
IV,III,CELIA,"I pray you, will you take him by the arm?"
IV,III,OLIVER,"Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a"
IV,III,OLIVER,"man's heart."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!"
IV,III,OLIVER,"This was not counterfeit: there is too great"
IV,III,OLIVER,"testimony in your complexion that it was a passion"
IV,III,OLIVER,"of earnest."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"Counterfeit, I assure you."
IV,III,OLIVER,"Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right."
IV,III,CELIA,"Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw"
IV,III,CELIA,"homewards. Good sir, go with us."
IV,III,OLIVER,"That will I, for I must bear answer back"
IV,III,OLIVER,"How you excuse my brother, Rosalind."
IV,III,ROSALIND,"I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend"
IV,III,ROSALIND,"my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey."
V,I,AUDREY,"Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old"
V,I,AUDREY,"gentleman's saying."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"forest lays claim to you."
V,I,AUDREY,"Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in"
V,I,AUDREY,"the world: here comes the man you mean."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"troth, we that have good wits have much to answer"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold."
V,I,WILLIAM,"Good even, Audrey."
V,I,AUDREY,"God ye good even, William."
V,I,WILLIAM,"And good even to you, sir."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?"
V,I,WILLIAM,"Five and twenty, sir."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"A ripe age. Is thy name William?"
V,I,WILLIAM,"William, sir."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?"
V,I,WILLIAM,"Ay, sir, I thank God."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?"
V,I,WILLIAM,"Faith, sir, so so."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?"
V,I,WILLIAM,"Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"lips to open. You do love this maid?"
V,I,WILLIAM,"I do, sir."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"Give me your hand. Art thou learned?"
V,I,WILLIAM,"No, sir."
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he."
V,I,WILLIAM,"Which he, sir?"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"female,--which in the common is woman; which"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"together is, abandon the society of this female, or,"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"thee away, translate thy life into death, thy"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"therefore tremble and depart."
V,I,AUDREY,"Do, good William."
V,I,WILLIAM,"God rest you merry, sir."
V,I,CORIN,"Our master and mistress seeks you; come, away, away!"
V,I,TOUCHSTONE,"Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend."
V,II,ORLANDO,"Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you"
V,II,ORLANDO,"should like her? that but seeing you should love"
V,II,ORLANDO,"her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should"
V,II,ORLANDO,"grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?"
V,II,OLIVER,"Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the"
V,II,OLIVER,"poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden"
V,II,OLIVER,"wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,"
V,II,OLIVER,"I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;"
V,II,OLIVER,"consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it"
V,II,OLIVER,"shall be to your good; for my father's house and all"
V,II,OLIVER,"the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I"
V,II,OLIVER,"estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd."
V,II,ORLANDO,"You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:"
V,II,ORLANDO,"thither will I invite the duke and all's contented"
V,II,ORLANDO,"followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look"
V,II,ORLANDO,"you, here comes my Rosalind."
V,II,ROSALIND,"God save you, brother."
V,II,OLIVER,"And you, fair sister."
V,II,ROSALIND,"O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee"
V,II,ROSALIND,"wear thy heart in a scarf!"
V,II,ORLANDO,"It is my arm."
V,II,ROSALIND,"I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws"
V,II,ROSALIND,"of a lion."
V,II,ORLANDO,"Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady."
V,II,ROSALIND,"Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to"
V,II,ROSALIND,"swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?"
V,II,ORLANDO,"Ay, and greater wonders than that."
V,II,ROSALIND,"O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was"
V,II,ROSALIND,"never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams"
V,II,ROSALIND,"and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and"
V,II,ROSALIND,"overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner"
V,II,ROSALIND,"met but they looked, no sooner looked but they"
V,II,ROSALIND,"loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner"
V,II,ROSALIND,"sighed but they asked one another the reason, no"
V,II,ROSALIND,"sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;"
V,II,ROSALIND,"and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs"
V,II,ROSALIND,"to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or"
V,II,ROSALIND,"else be incontinent before marriage: they are in"
V,II,ROSALIND,"the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs"
V,II,ROSALIND,"cannot part them."
V,II,ORLANDO,"They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the"
V,II,ORLANDO,"duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it"
V,II,ORLANDO,"is to look into happiness through another man's"
V,II,ORLANDO,"eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at"
V,II,ORLANDO,"the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall"
V,II,ORLANDO,"think my brother happy in having what he wishes for."
V,II,ROSALIND,"Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?"
V,II,ORLANDO,"I can live no longer by thinking."
V,II,ROSALIND,"I will weary you then no longer with idle talking."
V,II,ROSALIND,"Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,"
V,II,ROSALIND,"that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I"
V,II,ROSALIND,"speak not this that you should bear a good opinion"
V,II,ROSALIND,"of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;"
V,II,ROSALIND,"neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in"
V,II,ROSALIND,"some little measure draw a belief from you, to do"
V,II,ROSALIND,"yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if"
V,II,ROSALIND,"you please, that I can do strange things: I have,"
V,II,ROSALIND,"since I was three year old, conversed with a"
V,II,ROSALIND,"magician, most profound in his art and yet not"
V,II,ROSALIND,"damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart"
V,II,ROSALIND,"as your gesture cries it out, when your brother"
V,II,ROSALIND,"marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into"
V,II,ROSALIND,"what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is"
V,II,ROSALIND,"not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient"
V,II,ROSALIND,"to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human"
V,II,ROSALIND,"as she is and without any danger."
V,II,ORLANDO,"Speakest thou in sober meanings?"
V,II,ROSALIND,"By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I"
V,II,ROSALIND,"say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your"
V,II,ROSALIND,"best array: bid your friends; for if you will be"
V,II,ROSALIND,"married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will."
V,II,ROSALIND,"Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers."
V,II,PHEBE,"Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,"
V,II,PHEBE,"To show the letter that I writ to you."
V,II,ROSALIND,"I care not if I have: it is my study"
V,II,ROSALIND,"To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:"
V,II,ROSALIND,"You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;"
V,II,ROSALIND,"Look upon him, love him; he worships you."
V,II,PHEBE,"Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love."
V,II,SILVIUS,"It is to be all made of sighs and tears;"
V,II,SILVIUS,"And so am I for Phebe."
V,II,PHEBE,"And I for Ganymede."
V,II,ORLANDO,"And I for Rosalind."
V,II,ROSALIND,"And I for no woman."
V,II,SILVIUS,"It is to be all made of faith and service;"
V,II,SILVIUS,"And so am I for Phebe."
V,II,PHEBE,"And I for Ganymede."
V,II,ORLANDO,"And I for Rosalind."
V,II,ROSALIND,"And I for no woman."
V,II,SILVIUS,"It is to be all made of fantasy,"
V,II,SILVIUS,"All made of passion and all made of wishes,"
V,II,SILVIUS,"All adoration, duty, and observance,"
V,II,SILVIUS,"All humbleness, all patience and impatience,"
V,II,SILVIUS,"All purity, all trial, all observance;"
V,II,SILVIUS,"And so am I for Phebe."
V,II,PHEBE,"And so am I for Ganymede."
V,II,ORLANDO,"And so am I for Rosalind."
V,II,ROSALIND,"And so am I for no woman."
V,II,PHEBE,"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?"
V,II,SILVIUS,"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?"
V,II,ORLANDO,"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?"
V,II,ROSALIND,"Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'"
V,II,ORLANDO,"To her that is not here, nor doth not hear."
V,II,ROSALIND,"Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling"
V,II,ROSALIND,"of Irish wolves against the moon."
V,II,ROSALIND,"I will help you, if I can:"
V,II,ROSALIND,"I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together."
V,II,ROSALIND,"I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be"
V,II,ROSALIND,"married to-morrow:"
V,II,ROSALIND,"I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you"
V,II,ROSALIND,"shall be married to-morrow:"
V,II,ROSALIND,"I will content you, if what pleases you contents"
V,II,ROSALIND,"you, and you shall be married to-morrow."
V,II,ROSALIND,"As you love Rosalind, meet:"
V,II,ROSALIND,"as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,"
V,II,ROSALIND,"I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands."
V,II,SILVIUS,"I'll not fail, if I live."
V,II,PHEBE,"Nor I."
V,II,ORLANDO,"Nor I."
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will"
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"we be married."
V,III,AUDREY,"I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is"
V,III,AUDREY,"no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the"
V,III,AUDREY,"world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages."
V,III,First Page,"Well met, honest gentleman."
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song."
V,III,Second Page,"We are for you: sit i' the middle."
V,III,First Page,"Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or"
V,III,First Page,"spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only"
V,III,First Page,"prologues to a bad voice?"
V,III,Second Page,"I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two"
V,III,Second Page,"gipsies on a horse."
V,III,Second Page,"It was a lover and his lass,"
V,III,Second Page,"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,"
V,III,Second Page,"That o'er the green corn-field did pass"
V,III,Second Page,"In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,"
V,III,Second Page,"When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:"
V,III,Second Page,"Sweet lovers love the spring."
V,III,Second Page,"Between the acres of the rye,"
V,III,Second Page,"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino"
V,III,Second Page,"These pretty country folks would lie,"
V,III,Second Page,"In spring time, &c."
V,III,Second Page,"This carol they began that hour,"
V,III,Second Page,"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,"
V,III,Second Page,"How that a life was but a flower"
V,III,Second Page,"In spring time, &c."
V,III,Second Page,"And therefore take the present time,"
V,III,Second Page,"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;"
V,III,Second Page,"For love is crowned with the prime"
V,III,Second Page,"In spring time, &c."
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great"
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"matter in the ditty, yet the note was very"
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"untuneable."
V,III,First Page,"You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time."
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear"
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend"
V,III,TOUCHSTONE,"your voices! Come, Audrey."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Can do all this that he hath promised?"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"As those that fear they hope, and know they fear."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"You will bestow her on Orlando here?"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"That would I, were I of all kingdoms king."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?"
V,IV,PHEBE,"That will I, should I die the hour after."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"But if you do refuse to marry me,"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?"
V,IV,PHEBE,"So is the bargain."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?"
V,IV,SILVIUS,"Though to have her and death were both one thing."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"I have promised to make all this matter even."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"If she refuse me: and from hence I go,"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"To make these doubts all even."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"I do remember in this shepherd boy"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Some lively touches of my daughter's favour."
V,IV,ORLANDO,"My lord, the first time that I ever saw him"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"Methought he was a brother to your daughter:"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"Of many desperate studies by his uncle,"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"Whom he reports to be a great magician,"
V,IV,ORLANDO,"Obscured in the circle of this forest."
V,IV,JAQUES,"There is, sure, another flood toward, and these"
V,IV,JAQUES,"couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of"
V,IV,JAQUES,"very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools."
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Salutation and greeting to you all!"
V,IV,JAQUES,"Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the"
V,IV,JAQUES,"motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in"
V,IV,JAQUES,"the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears."
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"If any man doubt that, let him put me to my"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"had four quarrels, and like to have fought one."
V,IV,JAQUES,"And how was that ta'en up?"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"seventh cause."
V,IV,JAQUES,"How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"I like him very well."
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"By my faith, he is very swift and sententious."
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases."
V,IV,JAQUES,"But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the"
V,IV,JAQUES,"quarrel on the seventh cause?"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous."
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"would send me word, he cut it to please himself:"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Circumstantial and the Lie Direct."
V,IV,JAQUES,"And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"measured swords and parted."
V,IV,JAQUES,"Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"books for good manners: I will name you the degrees."
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"parties were met themselves, one of them thought but"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the"
V,IV,TOUCHSTONE,"only peacemaker; much virtue in If."
V,IV,JAQUES,"Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at"
V,IV,JAQUES,"any thing and yet a fool."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"the presentation of that he shoots his wit."
V,IV,HYMEN,"Then is there mirth in heaven,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"When earthly things made even"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Atone together."
V,IV,HYMEN,"Good duke, receive thy daughter"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Hymen from heaven brought her,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Yea, brought her hither,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"That thou mightst join her hand with his"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Whose heart within his bosom is."
V,IV,ROSALIND,"To you I give myself, for I am yours."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter."
V,IV,ORLANDO,"If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind."
V,IV,PHEBE,"If sight and shape be true,"
V,IV,PHEBE,"Why then, my love adieu!"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"I'll have no father, if you be not he:"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"I'll have no husband, if you be not he:"
V,IV,ROSALIND,"Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she."
V,IV,HYMEN,"Peace, ho! I bar confusion:"
V,IV,HYMEN,"'Tis I must make conclusion"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Of these most strange events:"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Here's eight that must take hands"
V,IV,HYMEN,"To join in Hymen's bands,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"If truth holds true contents."
V,IV,HYMEN,"You and you no cross shall part:"
V,IV,HYMEN,"You and you are heart in heart"
V,IV,HYMEN,"You to his love must accord,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Or have a woman to your lord:"
V,IV,HYMEN,"You and you are sure together,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"As the winter to foul weather."
V,IV,HYMEN,"Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Feed yourselves with questioning;"
V,IV,HYMEN,"That reason wonder may diminish,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"How thus we met, and these things finish."
V,IV,HYMEN,"Wedding is great Juno's crown:"
V,IV,HYMEN,"O blessed bond of board and bed!"
V,IV,HYMEN,"'Tis Hymen peoples every town;"
V,IV,HYMEN,"High wedlock then be honoured:"
V,IV,HYMEN,"Honour, high honour and renown,"
V,IV,HYMEN,"To Hymen, god of every town!"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree."
V,IV,PHEBE,"I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;"
V,IV,PHEBE,"Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine."
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"Let me have audience for a word or two:"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"That bring these tidings to this fair assembly."
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"Men of great worth resorted to this forest,"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"In his own conduct, purposely to take"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"His brother here and put him to the sword:"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"Where meeting with an old religious man,"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"After some question with him, was converted"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"Both from his enterprise and from the world,"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"And all their lands restored to them again"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"That were with him exiled. This to be true,"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"I do engage my life."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Welcome, young man;"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"To one his lands withheld, and to the other"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"A land itself at large, a potent dukedom."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"First, in this forest, let us do those ends"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"That here were well begun and well begot:"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"And after, every of this happy number"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"That have endured shrewd days and nights with us"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Shall share the good of our returned fortune,"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"According to the measure of their states."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"And fall into our rustic revelry."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall."
V,IV,JAQUES,"Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,"
V,IV,JAQUES,"The duke hath put on a religious life"
V,IV,JAQUES,"And thrown into neglect the pompous court?"
V,IV,JAQUES DE BOYS,"He hath."
V,IV,JAQUES,"To him will I : out of these convertites"
V,IV,JAQUES,"There is much matter to be heard and learn'd."
V,IV,JAQUES,"You to your former honour I bequeath;"
V,IV,JAQUES,"Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:"
V,IV,JAQUES,"You to a love that your true faith doth merit:"
V,IV,JAQUES,"You to your land and love and great allies:"
V,IV,JAQUES,"You to a long and well-deserved bed:"
V,IV,JAQUES,"And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage"
V,IV,JAQUES,"Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:"
V,IV,JAQUES,"I am for other than for dancing measures."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Stay, Jaques, stay."
V,IV,JAQUES,"To see no pastime I what you would have"
V,IV,JAQUES,"I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave."
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,"
V,IV,DUKE SENIOR,"As we do trust they'll end, in true delights."
