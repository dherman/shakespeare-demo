I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Since last we saw in France?"
I,I,NORFOLK,"I thank your grace,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Of what I saw there."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"An untimely ague"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Met in the vale of Andren."
I,I,NORFOLK,"'Twixt Guynes and Arde:"
I,I,NORFOLK,"I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung"
I,I,NORFOLK,"In their embracement, as they grew together;"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Such a compounded one?"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"All the whole time"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I was my chamber's prisoner."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Then you lost"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The view of earthly glory: men might say,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Till this time pomp was single, but now married"
I,I,NORFOLK,"To one above itself. Each following day"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Became the next day's master, till the last"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Made former wonders its. To-day the French,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Made Britain India: every man that stood"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were"
I,I,NORFOLK,"As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The pride upon them, that their very labour"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Was to them as a painting: now this masque"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"As presence did present them; him in eye,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Still him in praise: and, being present both"
I,I,NORFOLK,"'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--"
I,I,NORFOLK,"For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The noble spirits to arms, they did perform"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Being now seen possible enough, got credit,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"That Bevis was believed."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"O, you go far."
I,I,NORFOLK,"As I belong to worship and affect"
I,I,NORFOLK,"In honour honesty, the tract of every thing"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Would by a good discourser lose some life,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;"
I,I,NORFOLK,"To the disposing of it nought rebell'd."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Order gave each thing view; the office did"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Distinctly his full function."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Who did guide,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I mean, who set the body and the limbs"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Of this great sport together, as you guess?"
I,I,NORFOLK,"One, certes, that promises no element"
I,I,NORFOLK,"In such a business."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I pray you, who, my lord?"
I,I,NORFOLK,"All this was order'd by the good discretion"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Of the right reverend Cardinal of York."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"From his ambitious finger. What had he"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"That such a keech can with his very bulk"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And keep it from the earth."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Surely, sir,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;"
I,I,NORFOLK,"For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon"
I,I,NORFOLK,"For high feats done to the crown; neither allied"
I,I,NORFOLK,"For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The force of his own merit makes his way"
I,I,NORFOLK,"A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys"
I,I,NORFOLK,"A place next to the king."
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"I cannot tell"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"Pierce into that; but I can see his pride"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"Or has given all before, and he begins"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"A new hell in himself."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Why the devil,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Upon this French going out, took he upon him,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Without the privity o' the king, to appoint"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Who should attend on him? He makes up the file"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Of all the gentry; for the most part such"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To whom as great a charge as little honour"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"The honourable board of council out,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Must fetch him in the papers."
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"I do know"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"By this so sickened their estates, that never"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"They shall abound as formerly."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"O, many"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"For this great journey. What did this vanity"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"But minister communication of"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"A most poor issue?"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Grievingly I think,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The peace between the French and us not values"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The cost that did conclude it."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Every man,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"After the hideous storm that follow'd, was"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"The sudden breach on't."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Which is budded out;"
I,I,NORFOLK,"For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux."
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"Is it therefore"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"The ambassador is silenced?"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Marry, is't."
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"A proper title of a peace; and purchased"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"At a superfluous rate!"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Why, all this business"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Our reverend cardinal carried."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Like it your grace,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The state takes notice of the private difference"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--"
I,I,NORFOLK,"And take it from a heart that wishes towards you"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Honour and plenteous safety--that you read"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The cardinal's malice and his potency"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Together; to consider further that"
I,I,NORFOLK,"What his high hatred would effect wants not"
I,I,NORFOLK,"A minister in his power. You know his nature,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"That he's revengeful, and I know his sword"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock"
I,I,NORFOLK,"That I advise your shunning."
I,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?"
I,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Where's his examination?"
I,I,First Secretary,"Here, so please you."
I,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Is he in person ready?"
I,I,First Secretary,"Ay, please your grace."
I,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham"
I,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Shall lessen this big look."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Outworths a noble's blood."
I,I,NORFOLK,"What, are you chafed?"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Which your disease requires."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I read in's looks"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Matter against me; and his eye reviled"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Me, as his abject object: at this instant"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I'll follow and outstare him."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Stay, my lord,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"And let your reason with your choler question"
I,I,NORFOLK,"What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Requires slow pace at first: anger is like"
I,I,NORFOLK,"A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Can advise me like you: be to yourself"
I,I,NORFOLK,"As you would to your friend."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I'll to the king;"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And from a mouth of honour quite cry down"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"There's difference in no persons."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Be advised;"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot"
I,I,NORFOLK,"That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"By violent swiftness, that which we run at,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"And lose by over-running. Know you not,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:"
I,I,NORFOLK,"I say again, there is no English soul"
I,I,NORFOLK,"More stronger to direct you than yourself,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"If with the sap of reason you would quench,"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Or but allay, the fire of passion."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Sir,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I am thankful to you; and I'll go along"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Whom from the flow of gall I name not but"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"From sincere motions, by intelligence,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And proofs as clear as founts in July when"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"We see each grain of gravel, I do know"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To be corrupt and treasonous."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Say not 'treasonous.'"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As able to perform't; his mind and place"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Only to show his pomp as well in France"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As here at home, suggests the king our master"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To this last costly treaty, the interview,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Did break i' the rinsing."
I,I,NORFOLK,"Faith, and so it did."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"The articles o' the combination drew"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As himself pleased; and they were ratified"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"His fears were, that the interview betwixt"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"England and France might, through their amity,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Breed him some prejudice; for from this league"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"That he would please to alter the king's course,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And for his own advantage."
I,I,NORFOLK,"I am sorry"
I,I,NORFOLK,"To hear this of him; and could wish he were"
I,I,NORFOLK,"Something mistaken in't."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"No, not a syllable:"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I  do pronounce him in that very shape"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"He shall appear in proof."
I,I,BRANDON,"Your office, sergeant; execute it."
I,I,Sergeant,"Sir,"
I,I,Sergeant,"My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl"
I,I,Sergeant,"Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I"
I,I,Sergeant,"Arrest thee of high treason, in the name"
I,I,Sergeant,"Of our most sovereign king."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Lo, you, my lord,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Under device and practise."
I,I,BRANDON,"I am sorry"
I,I,BRANDON,"To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on"
I,I,BRANDON,"The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure"
I,I,BRANDON,"You shall to the Tower."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"It will help me nothing"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Be done in this and all things! I obey."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!"
I,I,BRANDON,"Nay, he must bear you company. The king"
I,I,BRANDON,"Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know"
I,I,BRANDON,"How he determines further."
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"As the duke said,"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure"
I,I,ABERGAVENNY,"By me obey'd!"
I,I,BRANDON,"Here is a warrant from"
I,I,BRANDON,"The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies"
I,I,BRANDON,"Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,"
I,I,BRANDON,"One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"So, so;"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope."
I,I,BRANDON,"A monk o' the Chartreux."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"O, Nicholas Hopkins?"
I,I,BRANDON,"He."
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,"
I,I,BUCKINGHAM,"By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"My life itself, and the best heart of it,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"I'll hear him his confessions justify;"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And point by point the treasons of his master"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"He shall again relate."
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Arise, and take place by us: half your suit"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Never name to us; you have half our power:"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Repeat your will and take it."
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Thank your majesty."
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That you would love yourself, and in that love"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The dignity of your office, is the point"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Of my petition."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Lady mine, proceed."
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I am solicited, not by a few,"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And those of true condition, that your subjects"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Are in great grievance: there have been commissions"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Most bitterly on you, as putter on"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Of these exactions, yet the king our master--"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"escapes not"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The sides of loyalty, and almost appears"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In loud rebellion."
I,II,NORFOLK,"Not almost appears,"
I,II,NORFOLK,"It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,"
I,II,NORFOLK,"The clothiers all, not able to maintain"
I,II,NORFOLK,"The many to them longing, have put off"
I,II,NORFOLK,"The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,"
I,II,NORFOLK,"Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger"
I,II,NORFOLK,"And lack of other means, in desperate manner"
I,II,NORFOLK,"Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,"
I,II,NORFOLK,"And danger serves among then!"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Taxation!"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"You that are blamed for it alike with us,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Know you of this taxation?"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Please you, sir,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know but of a single part, in aught"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Pertains to the state; and front but in that file"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Where others tell steps with me."
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"No, my lord,"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You know no more than others; but you frame"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To those which would not know them, and yet must"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The back is sacrifice to the load. They say"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They are devised by you; or else you suffer"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Too hard an exclamation."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Still exaction!"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Is this exaction?"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I am much too venturous"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Comes through commissions, which compel from each"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The sixth part of his substance, to be levied"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Without delay; and the pretence for this"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Allegiance in them; their curses now"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"This tractable obedience is a slave"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To each incensed will. I would your highness"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Would give it quick consideration, for"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"There is no primer business."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"By my life,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"This is against our pleasure."
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And for me,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I have no further gone in this than by"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A single voice; and that not pass'd me but"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By learned approbation of the judges. If I am"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My faculties nor person, yet will be"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The chronicles of my doing, let me say"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That virtue must go through. We must not stint"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Our necessary actions, in the fear"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To cope malicious censurers; which ever,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For our best act. If we shall stand still,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"We should take root here where we sit, or sit"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"State-statues only."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Things done well,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Things done without example, in their issue"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Of this commission? I believe, not any."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"We must not rend our subjects from our laws,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"A trembling contribution! Why, we take"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The air will drink the sap. To every county"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Where this is question'd send our letters, with"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Free pardon to each man that has denied"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The force of this commission: pray, look to't;"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"I put it to your care."
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A word with you."
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let there be letters writ to every shire,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That through our intercession this revokement"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Further in the proceeding."
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Is run in your displeasure."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"It grieves many:"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To nature none more bound; his training such,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"When these so noble benefits shall prove"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Hath into monstrous habits put the graces"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"That once were his, and is become as black"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"This was his gentleman in trust--of him"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The fore-recited practises; whereof"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"We cannot feel too little, hear too much."
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Most like a careful subject, have collected"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Out of the Duke of Buckingham."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Speak freely."
I,II,Surveyor,"First, it was usual with him, every day"
I,II,Surveyor,"It would infect his speech, that if the king"
I,II,Surveyor,"Should without issue die, he'll carry it so"
I,II,Surveyor,"To make the sceptre his: these very words"
I,II,Surveyor,"I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,"
I,II,Surveyor,"Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced"
I,II,Surveyor,"Revenge upon the cardinal."
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Please your highness, note"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This dangerous conception in this point."
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Not friended by by his wish, to your high person"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"His will is most malignant; and it stretches"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Beyond you, to your friends."
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My learn'd lord cardinal,"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Deliver all with charity."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Speak on:"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"How grounded he his title to the crown,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"At any time speak aught?"
I,II,Surveyor,"He was brought to this"
I,II,Surveyor,"By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"What was that Hopkins?"
I,II,Surveyor,"Sir, a Chartreux friar,"
I,II,Surveyor,"His confessor, who fed him every minute"
I,II,Surveyor,"With words of sovereignty."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"How know'st thou this?"
I,II,Surveyor,"Not long before your highness sped to France,"
I,II,Surveyor,"The duke being at the Rose, within the parish"
I,II,Surveyor,"Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand"
I,II,Surveyor,"What was the speech among the Londoners"
I,II,Surveyor,"Concerning the French journey: I replied,"
I,II,Surveyor,"Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,"
I,II,Surveyor,"To the king's danger. Presently the duke"
I,II,Surveyor,"Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted"
I,II,Surveyor,"'Twould prove the verity of certain words"
I,II,Surveyor,"Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,"
I,II,Surveyor,"'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit"
I,II,Surveyor,"John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour"
I,II,Surveyor,"To hear from him a matter of some moment:"
I,II,Surveyor,"Whom after under the confession's seal"
I,II,Surveyor,"He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke"
I,II,Surveyor,"My chaplain to no creature living, but"
I,II,Surveyor,"To me, should utter, with demure confidence"
I,II,Surveyor,"This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,"
I,II,Surveyor,"Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive"
I,II,Surveyor,"To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke"
I,II,Surveyor,"Shall govern England.'"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"If I know you well,"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You charge not in your spleen a noble person"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Yes, heartily beseech you."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Let him on."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Go forward."
I,II,Surveyor,"On my soul, I'll speak but truth."
I,II,Surveyor,"I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions"
I,II,Surveyor,"The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him"
I,II,Surveyor,"To ruminate on this so far, until"
I,II,Surveyor,"It forged him some design, which, being believed,"
I,II,Surveyor,"It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,"
I,II,Surveyor,"It can do me no damage;' adding further,"
I,II,Surveyor,"That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,"
I,II,Surveyor,"The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads"
I,II,Surveyor,"Should have gone off."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?"
I,II,Surveyor,"I can, my liege."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Proceed."
I,II,Surveyor,"Being at Greenwich,"
I,II,Surveyor,"After your highness had reproved the duke"
I,II,Surveyor,"About Sir William Blomer,--"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"I remember"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Of such a time: being my sworn servant,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?"
I,II,Surveyor,"'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,"
I,II,Surveyor,"As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd"
I,II,Surveyor,"The part my father meant to act upon"
I,II,Surveyor,"The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,"
I,II,Surveyor,"Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,"
I,II,Surveyor,"As he made semblance of his duty, would"
I,II,Surveyor,"Have put his knife to him.'"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"A giant traitor!"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,"
I,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"and this man out of prison?"
I,II,QUEEN KATHARINE,"God mend all!"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?"
I,II,Surveyor,"After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'"
I,II,Surveyor,"He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,"
I,II,Surveyor,"Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes"
I,II,Surveyor,"He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor"
I,II,Surveyor,"Was,--were he evil used, he would outgo"
I,II,Surveyor,"His father by as much as a performance"
I,II,Surveyor,"Does an irresolute purpose."
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"There's his period,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Call him to present trial: if he may"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Find mercy in the law, 'tis his: if none,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night,"
I,II,KING HENRY VIII,"He's traitor to the height."
I,III,Chamberlain,"Is't possible the spells of France should juggle"
I,III,Chamberlain,"Men into such strange mysteries?"
I,III,SANDS,"New customs,"
I,III,SANDS,"Though they be never so ridiculous,"
I,III,SANDS,"Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd."
I,III,Chamberlain,"As far as I see, all the good our English"
I,III,Chamberlain,"Have got by the late voyage is but merely"
I,III,Chamberlain,"A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;"
I,III,Chamberlain,"For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly"
I,III,Chamberlain,"Their very noses had been counsellors"
I,III,Chamberlain,"To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so."
I,III,SANDS,"They have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,"
I,III,SANDS,"That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin"
I,III,SANDS,"Or springhalt reign'd among 'em."
I,III,Chamberlain,"Death! my lord,"
I,III,Chamberlain,"Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,"
I,III,Chamberlain,"That, sure, they've worn out Christendom."
I,III,Chamberlain,"How now!"
I,III,Chamberlain,"What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?"
I,III,LOVELL,"Faith, my lord,"
I,III,LOVELL,"I hear of none, but the new proclamation"
I,III,LOVELL,"That's clapp'd upon the court-gate."
I,III,Chamberlain,"What is't for?"
I,III,LOVELL,"The reformation of our travell'd gallants,"
I,III,LOVELL,"That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors."
I,III,Chamberlain,"I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs"
I,III,Chamberlain,"To think an English courtier may be wise,"
I,III,Chamberlain,"And never see the Louvre."
I,III,LOVELL,"They must either,"
I,III,LOVELL,"For so run the conditions, leave those remnants"
I,III,LOVELL,"Of fool and feather that they got in France,"
I,III,LOVELL,"With all their honourable point of ignorance"
I,III,LOVELL,"Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,"
I,III,LOVELL,"Abusing better men than they can be,"
I,III,LOVELL,"Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean"
I,III,LOVELL,"The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,"
I,III,LOVELL,"Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,"
I,III,LOVELL,"And understand again like honest men;"
I,III,LOVELL,"Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,"
I,III,LOVELL,"They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear away"
I,III,LOVELL,"The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at."
I,III,SANDS,"'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases"
I,III,SANDS,"Are grown so catching."
I,III,Chamberlain,"What a loss our ladies"
I,III,Chamberlain,"Will have of these trim vanities!"
I,III,LOVELL,"Ay, marry,"
I,III,LOVELL,"There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons"
I,III,LOVELL,"Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;"
I,III,LOVELL,"A French song and a fiddle has no fellow."
I,III,SANDS,"The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,"
I,III,SANDS,"For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now"
I,III,SANDS,"An honest country lord, as I am, beaten"
I,III,SANDS,"A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong"
I,III,SANDS,"And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,"
I,III,SANDS,"Held current music too."
I,III,Chamberlain,"Well said, Lord Sands;"
I,III,Chamberlain,"Your colt's tooth is not cast yet."
I,III,SANDS,"No, my lord;"
I,III,SANDS,"Nor shall not, while I have a stump."
I,III,Chamberlain,"Sir Thomas,"
I,III,Chamberlain,"Whither were you a-going?"
I,III,LOVELL,"To the cardinal's:"
I,III,LOVELL,"Your lordship is a guest too."
I,III,Chamberlain,"O, 'tis true:"
I,III,Chamberlain,"This night he makes a supper, and a great one,"
I,III,Chamberlain,"To many lords and ladies; there will be"
I,III,Chamberlain,"The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you."
I,III,LOVELL,"That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,"
I,III,LOVELL,"A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;"
I,III,LOVELL,"His dews fall every where."
I,III,Chamberlain,"No doubt he's noble;"
I,III,Chamberlain,"He had a black mouth that said other of him."
I,III,SANDS,"He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him"
I,III,SANDS,"Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:"
I,III,SANDS,"Men of his way should be most liberal;"
I,III,SANDS,"They are set here for examples."
I,III,Chamberlain,"True, they are so:"
I,III,Chamberlain,"But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;"
I,III,Chamberlain,"Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,"
I,III,Chamberlain,"We shall be late else; which I would not be,"
I,III,Chamberlain,"For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford"
I,III,Chamberlain,"This night to be comptrollers."
I,III,SANDS,"I am your lordship's."
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"Ladies, a general welcome from his grace"
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates"
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"To fair content and you: none here, he hopes,"
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"In all this noble bevy, has brought with her"
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"One care abroad; he would have all as merry"
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,"
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"Can make good people. O, my lord, you're tardy:"
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"The very thought of this fair company"
I,IV,GUILDFORD,"Clapp'd wings to me."
I,IV,Chamberlain,"You are young, Sir Harry Guildford."
I,IV,SANDS,"Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal"
I,IV,SANDS,"But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these"
I,IV,SANDS,"Should find a running banquet ere they rested,"
I,IV,SANDS,"I think would better please 'em: by my life,"
I,IV,SANDS,"They are a sweet society of fair ones."
I,IV,LOVELL,"O, that your lordship were but now confessor"
I,IV,LOVELL,"To one or two of these!"
I,IV,SANDS,"I would I were;"
I,IV,SANDS,"They should find easy penance."
I,IV,LOVELL,"Faith, how easy?"
I,IV,SANDS,"As easy as a down-bed would afford it."
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Two women placed together makes cold weather:"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Pray, sit between these ladies."
I,IV,SANDS,"By my faith,"
I,IV,SANDS,"And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:"
I,IV,SANDS,"If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;"
I,IV,SANDS,"I had it from my father."
I,IV,ANNE,"Was he mad, sir?"
I,IV,SANDS,"O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:"
I,IV,SANDS,"But he would bite none; just as I do now,"
I,IV,SANDS,"He would kiss you twenty with a breath."
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Well said, my lord."
I,IV,Chamberlain,"So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Pass away frowning."
I,IV,SANDS,"For my little cure,"
I,IV,SANDS,"Let me alone."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And to you all, good health."
I,IV,SANDS,"Your grace is noble:"
I,IV,SANDS,"Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,"
I,IV,SANDS,"And save me so much talking."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My Lord Sands,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Whose fault is this?"
I,IV,SANDS,"The red wine first must rise"
I,IV,SANDS,"In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em"
I,IV,SANDS,"Talk us to silence."
I,IV,ANNE,"You are a merry gamester,"
I,IV,ANNE,"My Lord Sands."
I,IV,SANDS,"Yes, if I make my play."
I,IV,SANDS,"Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,"
I,IV,SANDS,"For 'tis to such a thing,--"
I,IV,ANNE,"You cannot show me."
I,IV,SANDS,"I told your grace they would talk anon."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What's that?"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Look out there, some of ye."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What warlike voice,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By all the laws of war you're privileged."
I,IV,Chamberlain,"How now! what is't?"
I,IV,Servant,"A noble troop of strangers;"
I,IV,Servant,"For so they seem: they've left their barge and landed;"
I,IV,Servant,"And hither make, as great ambassadors"
I,IV,Servant,"From foreign princes."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Good lord chamberlain,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And, pray, receive 'em nobly, and conduct 'em"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A good digestion to you all: and once more"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I shower a welcome on ye; welcome all."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A noble company! what are their pleasures?"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Of this so noble and so fair assembly"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"This night to meet here, they could do no less"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"An hour of revels with 'em."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Say, lord chamberlain,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures."
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Till now I never knew thee!"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My lord!"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Your grace?"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"More worthy this place than myself; to whom,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"If I but knew him, with my love and duty"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I would surrender it."
I,IV,Chamberlain,"I will, my lord."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What say they?"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Such a one, they all confess,"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"There is indeed; which they would have your grace"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"Find out, and he will take it."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let me see, then."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My royal choice."
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Ye have found him, cardinal:"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I should judge now unhappily."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I am glad"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Your grace is grown so pleasant."
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"My lord chamberlain,"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--"
I,IV,Chamberlain,"The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness' women."
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I were unmannerly, to take you out,"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Let it go round."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I' the privy chamber?"
I,IV,LOVELL,"Yes, my lord."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Your grace,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I fear, with dancing is a little heated."
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I fear, too much."
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There's fresher air, my lord,"
I,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In the next chamber."
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I must not yet forsake you: let's be merry:"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Good my lord cardinal, I have half a dozen healths"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream"
I,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it."
II,I,First Gentleman,"Whither away so fast?"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"O, God save ye!"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Even to the hall, to hear what shall become"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Of the great Duke of Buckingham."
II,I,First Gentleman,"I'll save you"
II,I,First Gentleman,"That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Of bringing back the prisoner."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Were you there?"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Yes, indeed, was I."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Pray, speak what has happen'd."
II,I,First Gentleman,"You may guess quickly what."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Is he found guilty?"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"I am sorry for't."
II,I,First Gentleman,"So are a number more."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"But, pray, how pass'd it?"
II,I,First Gentleman,"I'll tell you in a little. The great duke"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Came to the bar; where to his accusations"
II,I,First Gentleman,"He pleaded still not guilty and alleged"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Many sharp reasons to defeat the law."
II,I,First Gentleman,"The king's attorney on the contrary"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired"
II,I,First Gentleman,"To have brought viva voce to his face:"
II,I,First Gentleman,"At which appear'd against him his surveyor;"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Hopkins, that made this mischief."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"That was he"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"That fed him with his prophecies?"
II,I,First Gentleman,"The same."
II,I,First Gentleman,"All these accused him strongly; which he fain"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:"
II,I,First Gentleman,"And so his peers, upon this evidence,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Have found him guilty of high treason. Much"
II,I,First Gentleman,"He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Was either pitied in him or forgotten."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"After all this, how did he bear himself?"
II,I,First Gentleman,"When he was brought again to the bar, to hear"
II,I,First Gentleman,"His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd"
II,I,First Gentleman,"With such an agony, he sweat extremely,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:"
II,I,First Gentleman,"But he fell to himself again, and sweetly"
II,I,First Gentleman,"In all the rest show'd a most noble patience."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"I do not think he fears death."
II,I,First Gentleman,"Sure, he does not:"
II,I,First Gentleman,"He never was so womanish; the cause"
II,I,First Gentleman,"He may a little grieve at."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Certainly"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"The cardinal is the end of this."
II,I,First Gentleman,"'Tis likely,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Lest he should help his father."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"That trick of state"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Was a deep envious one."
II,I,First Gentleman,"At his return"
II,I,First Gentleman,"No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"And generally, whoever the king favours,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"The cardinal instantly will find employment,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"And far enough from court too."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"All the commons"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"The mirror of all courtesy;--"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Stay there, sir,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Let's stand close, and behold him."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"All good people,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"You that thus far have come to pity me,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I have this day received a traitor's judgment,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"The law I bear no malice for my death;"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"For further life in this world I ne'er hope,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Is only bitter to him, only dying,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Go with me, like good angels, to my end;"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name."
II,I,LOVELL,"I do beseech your grace, for charity,"
II,I,LOVELL,"If ever any malice in your heart"
II,I,LOVELL,"Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"There cannot be those numberless offences"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"no black envy"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Longer than I have time to tell his years!"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And when old time shall lead him to his end,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Goodness and he fill up one monument!"
II,I,LOVELL,"To the water side I must conduct your grace;"
II,I,LOVELL,"Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,"
II,I,LOVELL,"Who undertakes you to your end."
II,I,VAUX,"Prepare there,"
II,I,VAUX,"The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;"
II,I,VAUX,"And fit it with such furniture as suits"
II,I,VAUX,"The greatness of his person."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Nay, Sir Nicholas,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Let it alone; my state now will but mock me."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"When I came hither, I was lord high constable"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet I am richer than my base accusers,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Who first raised head against usurping Richard,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Flying for succor to his servant Banister,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"My father's loss, like a most royal prince,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Made my name once more noble. Now his son,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"That made me happy at one stroke has taken"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"For ever from the world. I had my trial,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"A little happier than my wretched father:"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"A most unnatural and faithless service!"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"This from a dying man receive as certain:"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And give your hearts to, when they once perceive"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"The least rub in your fortunes, fall away"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Like water from ye, never found again"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And when you would say something that is sad,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!"
II,I,First Gentleman,"O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"I fear, too many curses on their beads"
II,I,First Gentleman,"That were the authors."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"If the duke be guiltless,"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Greater than this."
II,I,First Gentleman,"Good angels keep it from us!"
II,I,First Gentleman,"What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"This secret is so weighty, 'twill require"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"A strong faith to conceal it."
II,I,First Gentleman,"Let me have it;"
II,I,First Gentleman,"I do not talk much."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"I am confident,"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"A buzzing of a separation"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Between the king and Katharine?"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Yes, but it held not:"
II,I,First Gentleman,"For when the king once heard it, out of anger"
II,I,First Gentleman,"He sent command to the lord mayor straight"
II,I,First Gentleman,"To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues"
II,I,First Gentleman,"That durst disperse it."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"But that slander, sir,"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Is found a truth now: for it grows again"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Or some about him near, have, out of malice"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"That will undo her: to confirm this too,"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"As all think, for this business."
II,I,First Gentleman,"'Tis the cardinal;"
II,I,First Gentleman,"And merely to revenge him on the emperor"
II,I,First Gentleman,"For not bestowing on him, at his asking,"
II,I,First Gentleman,"The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed."
II,I,Second Gentleman,"I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal"
II,I,Second Gentleman,"Will have his will, and she must fall."
II,I,First Gentleman,"'Tis woful."
II,I,First Gentleman,"We are too open here to argue this;"
II,I,First Gentleman,"Let's think in private more."
II,II,Chamberlain,"'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with"
II,II,Chamberlain,"all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and"
II,II,Chamberlain,"furnished. They were young and handsome, and of the"
II,II,Chamberlain,"best breed in the north. When they were ready to"
II,II,Chamberlain,"set out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, by"
II,II,Chamberlain,"commission and main power, took 'em from me; with"
II,II,Chamberlain,"this reason: His master would be served before a"
II,II,Chamberlain,"subject, if not before the king; which stopped our"
II,II,Chamberlain,"mouths, sir.'"
II,II,Chamberlain,"I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:"
II,II,Chamberlain,"He will have all, I think."
II,II,NORFOLK,"Well met, my lord chamberlain."
II,II,Chamberlain,"Good day to both your graces."
II,II,SUFFOLK,"How is the king employ'd?"
II,II,Chamberlain,"I left him private,"
II,II,Chamberlain,"Full of sad thoughts and troubles."
II,II,NORFOLK,"What's the cause?"
II,II,Chamberlain,"It seems the marriage with his brother's wife"
II,II,Chamberlain,"Has crept too near his conscience."
II,II,SUFFOLK,"No, his conscience"
II,II,SUFFOLK,"Has crept too near another lady."
II,II,NORFOLK,"'Tis so:"
II,II,NORFOLK,"This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:"
II,II,NORFOLK,"That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Turns what he list. The king will know him one day."
II,II,SUFFOLK,"Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else."
II,II,NORFOLK,"How holily he works in all his business!"
II,II,NORFOLK,"And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,"
II,II,NORFOLK,"He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:"
II,II,NORFOLK,"And out of all these to restore the king,"
II,II,NORFOLK,"He counsels a divorce; a loss of her"
II,II,NORFOLK,"That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years"
II,II,NORFOLK,"About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Of her that loves him with that excellence"
II,II,NORFOLK,"That angels love good men with; even of her"
II,II,NORFOLK,"That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?"
II,II,Chamberlain,"Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true"
II,II,Chamberlain,"These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,"
II,II,Chamberlain,"And every true heart weeps for't: all that dare"
II,II,Chamberlain,"Look into these affairs see this main end,"
II,II,Chamberlain,"The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open"
II,II,Chamberlain,"The king's eyes, that so long have slept upon"
II,II,Chamberlain,"This bold bad man."
II,II,SUFFOLK,"And free us from his slavery."
II,II,NORFOLK,"We had need pray,"
II,II,NORFOLK,"And heartily, for our deliverance;"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Or this imperious man will work us all"
II,II,NORFOLK,"From princes into pages: all men's honours"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Into what pitch he please."
II,II,SUFFOLK,"For me, my lords,"
II,II,SUFFOLK,"I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:"
II,II,SUFFOLK,"As I am made without him, so I'll stand,"
II,II,SUFFOLK,"If the king please; his curses and his blessings"
II,II,SUFFOLK,"Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in."
II,II,SUFFOLK,"I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him"
II,II,SUFFOLK,"To him that made him proud, the pope."
II,II,NORFOLK,"Let's in;"
II,II,NORFOLK,"And with some other business put the king"
II,II,NORFOLK,"From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:"
II,II,NORFOLK,"My lord, you'll bear us company?"
II,II,Chamberlain,"Excuse me;"
II,II,Chamberlain,"The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,"
II,II,Chamberlain,"You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:"
II,II,Chamberlain,"Health to your lordships."
II,II,NORFOLK,"Thanks, my good lord chamberlain."
II,II,SUFFOLK,"How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Who's there, ha?"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Pray God he be not angry."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Into my private meditations?"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Who am I? ha?"
II,II,NORFOLK,"A gracious king that pardons all offences"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way"
II,II,NORFOLK,"Is business of estate; in which we come"
II,II,NORFOLK,"To know your royal pleasure."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Ye are too bold:"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Who's there? my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The quiet of my wounded conscience;"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Thou art a cure fit for a king."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"You're welcome,"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom:"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Use us and it."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"My good lord, have great care"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"I be not found a talker."
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Sir, you cannot."
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I would your grace would give us but an hour"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of private conference."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"We are busy; go."
II,II,NORFOLK,"This priest has no pride in him?"
II,II,SUFFOLK,"I would not be so sick though for his place:"
II,II,SUFFOLK,"But this cannot continue."
II,II,NORFOLK,"I'll venture one have-at-him."
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Above all princes, in committing freely"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Must now confess, if they have any goodness,"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The trial just and noble. All the clerks,"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Invited by your noble self, hath sent"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"One general tongue unto us, this good man,"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Whom once more I present unto your highness."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And thank the holy conclave for their loves:"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for."
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"You are so noble. To your highness' hand"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"I tender my commission; by whose virtue,"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"In the unpartial judging of this business."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know your majesty has always loved her"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"So dear in heart, not to deny her that"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A woman of less place might ask by law:"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"I find him a fit fellow."
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"favour to you;"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You are the king's now."
II,II,GARDINER,"But to be commanded"
II,II,GARDINER,"For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Come hither, Gardiner."
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"In this man's place before him?"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Yes, he was."
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Was he not held a learned man?"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Yes, surely."
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Even of yourself, lord cardinal."
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"How! of me?"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"They will not stick to say you envied him,"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,"
II,II,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"That he ran mad and died."
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Heaven's peace be with him!"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"If I command him, follows my appointment:"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,"
II,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Deliver this with modesty to the queen."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The most convenient place that I can think of"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"There ye shall meet about this weighty business."
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Would it not grieve an able man to leave"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!"
II,II,KING HENRY VIII,"O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her."
II,III,ANNE,"Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:"
II,III,ANNE,"His highness having lived so long with her, and she"
II,III,ANNE,"So good a lady that no tongue could ever"
II,III,ANNE,"Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,"
II,III,ANNE,"She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after"
II,III,ANNE,"So many courses of the sun enthroned,"
II,III,ANNE,"Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which"
II,III,ANNE,"To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than"
II,III,ANNE,"'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,"
II,III,ANNE,"To give her the avaunt! it is a pity"
II,III,ANNE,"Would move a monster."
II,III,Old Lady,"Hearts of most hard temper"
II,III,Old Lady,"Melt and lament for her."
II,III,ANNE,"O, God's will! much better"
II,III,ANNE,"She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,"
II,III,ANNE,"Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce"
II,III,ANNE,"It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging"
II,III,ANNE,"As soul and body's severing."
II,III,Old Lady,"Alas, poor lady!"
II,III,Old Lady,"She's a stranger now again."
II,III,ANNE,"So much the more"
II,III,ANNE,"Must pity drop upon her. Verily,"
II,III,ANNE,"I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,"
II,III,ANNE,"And range with humble livers in content,"
II,III,ANNE,"Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,"
II,III,ANNE,"And wear a golden sorrow."
II,III,Old Lady,"Our content"
II,III,Old Lady,"Is our best having."
II,III,ANNE,"By my troth and maidenhead,"
II,III,ANNE,"I would not be a queen."
II,III,Old Lady,"Beshrew me, I would,"
II,III,Old Lady,"And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,"
II,III,Old Lady,"For all this spice of your hypocrisy:"
II,III,Old Lady,"You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,"
II,III,Old Lady,"Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet"
II,III,Old Lady,"Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;"
II,III,Old Lady,"Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,"
II,III,Old Lady,"Saving your mincing, the capacity"
II,III,Old Lady,"Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,"
II,III,Old Lady,"If you might please to stretch it."
II,III,ANNE,"Nay, good troth."
II,III,Old Lady,"Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?"
II,III,ANNE,"No, not for all the riches under heaven."
II,III,Old Lady:,"'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,"
II,III,Old Lady:,"Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,"
II,III,Old Lady:,"What think you of a duchess? have you limbs"
II,III,Old Lady:,"To bear that load of title?"
II,III,ANNE,"No, in truth."
II,III,Old Lady,"Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;"
II,III,Old Lady,"I would not be a young count in your way,"
II,III,Old Lady,"For more than blushing comes to: if your back"
II,III,Old Lady,"Cannot vouchsafe this burthen,'tis too weak"
II,III,Old Lady,"Ever to get a boy."
II,III,ANNE,"How you do talk!"
II,III,ANNE,"I swear again, I would not be a queen"
II,III,ANNE,"For all the world."
II,III,Old Lady,"In faith, for little England"
II,III,Old Lady,"You'ld venture an emballing: I myself"
II,III,Old Lady,"Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd"
II,III,Old Lady,"No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know"
II,III,Chamberlain,"The secret of your conference?"
II,III,ANNE,"My good lord,"
II,III,ANNE,"Not your demand; it values not your asking:"
II,III,ANNE,"Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying."
II,III,Chamberlain,"It was a gentle business, and becoming"
II,III,Chamberlain,"The action of good women: there is hope"
II,III,Chamberlain,"All will be well."
II,III,ANNE,"Now, I pray God, amen!"
II,III,Chamberlain,"You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Commends his good opinion of you, and"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Does purpose honour to you no less flowing"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title"
II,III,Chamberlain,"A thousand pound a year, annual support,"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Out of his grace he adds."
II,III,ANNE,"I do not know"
II,III,ANNE,"What kind of my obedience I should tender;"
II,III,ANNE,"More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers"
II,III,ANNE,"Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes"
II,III,ANNE,"More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes"
II,III,ANNE,"Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,"
II,III,ANNE,"Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,"
II,III,ANNE,"As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;"
II,III,ANNE,"Whose health and royalty I pray for."
II,III,Chamberlain,"Lady,"
II,III,Chamberlain,"I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit"
II,III,Chamberlain,"The king hath of you."
II,III,Chamberlain,"I have perused her well;"
II,III,Chamberlain,"Beauty and honour in her are so mingled"
II,III,Chamberlain,"That they have caught the king: and who knows yet"
II,III,Chamberlain,"But from this lady may proceed a gem"
II,III,Chamberlain,"To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,"
II,III,Chamberlain,"And say I spoke with you."
II,III,ANNE,"My honour'd lord."
II,III,Old Lady,"Why, this it is; see, see!"
II,III,Old Lady,"I have been begging sixteen years in court,"
II,III,Old Lady,"Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could"
II,III,Old Lady,"Come pat betwixt too early and too late"
II,III,Old Lady,"For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!"
II,III,Old Lady,"A very fresh-fish here--fie, fie, fie upon"
II,III,Old Lady,"This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up"
II,III,Old Lady,"Before you open it."
II,III,ANNE,"This is strange to me."
II,III,Old Lady,"How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no."
II,III,Old Lady,"There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,"
II,III,Old Lady,"That would not be a queen, that would she not,"
II,III,Old Lady,"For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?"
II,III,ANNE,"Come, you are pleasant."
II,III,Old Lady,"With your theme, I could"
II,III,Old Lady,"O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!"
II,III,Old Lady,"A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!"
II,III,Old Lady,"No other obligation! By my life,"
II,III,Old Lady,"That promises moe thousands: honour's train"
II,III,Old Lady,"Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time"
II,III,Old Lady,"I know your back will bear a duchess: say,"
II,III,Old Lady,"Are you not stronger than you were?"
II,III,ANNE,"Good lady,"
II,III,ANNE,"Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,"
II,III,ANNE,"And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,"
II,III,ANNE,"If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,"
II,III,ANNE,"To think what follows."
II,III,ANNE,"The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful"
II,III,ANNE,"In our long absence: pray, do not deliver"
II,III,ANNE,"What here you've heard to her."
II,III,Old Lady,"What do you think me?"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Whilst our commission from Rome is read,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let silence be commanded."
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"What's the need?"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"It hath already publicly been read,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"And on all sides the authority allow'd;"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"You may, then, spare that time."
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Be't so. Proceed."
II,IV,Scribe,"Say, Henry King of England, come into the court."
II,IV,Crier,"Henry King of England, &c."
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Here."
II,IV,Scribe,"Say, Katharine Queen of England, come into the court."
II,IV,Crier,"Katharine Queen of England, &c."
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And to bestow your pity on me: for"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Born out of your dominions; having here"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In what have I offended you? what cause"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That thus you should proceed to put me off,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I have been to you a true and humble wife,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"At all times to your will conformable;"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"As I saw it inclined: when was the hour"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I ever contradicted your desire,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Have I not strove to love, although I knew"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"He were mine enemy? what friend of mine"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That had to him derived your anger, did I"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That I have been your wife, in this obedience,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Upward of twenty years, and have been blest"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"With many children by you: if, in the course"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And process of this time, you can report,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And prove it too, against mine honour aught,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Against your sacred person, in God's name,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Shut door upon me, and so give me up"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The king, your father, was reputed for"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"A prince most prudent, of an excellent"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"A year before: it is not to be question'd"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That they had gather'd a wise council to them"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Of every realm, that did debate this business,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Your pleasure be fulfill'd!"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You have here, lady,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of singular integrity and learning,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That longer you desire the court; as well"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For your own quiet, as to rectify"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What is unsettled in the king."
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"His grace"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"It's fit this royal session do proceed;"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"And that, without delay, their arguments"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Be now produced and heard."
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Lord cardinal,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To you I speak."
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Your pleasure, madam?"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Sir,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I am about to weep; but, thinking that"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The daughter of a king, my drops of tears"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I'll turn to sparks of fire."
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Be patient yet."
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I will, when you are humble; nay, before,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Or God will punish me. I do believe,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Induced by potent circumstances, that"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You are mine enemy, and make my challenge"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You shall not be my judge: for it is you"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I hold my most malicious foe, and think not"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"At all a friend to truth."
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I do profess"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You speak not like yourself; who ever yet"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I have no spleen against you; nor injustice"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For you or any: how far I have proceeded,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Or how far further shall, is warranted"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By a commission from the consistory,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The king is present: if it be known to him"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"As you have done my truth. If he know"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That I am free of your report, he knows"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Remove these thoughts from you: the which before"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"His highness shall speak in, I do beseech"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And to say so no more."
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My lord, my lord,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I am a simple woman, much too weak"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To oppose your cunning. You're meek and"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"humble-mouth'd;"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"With meekness and humility; but your heart"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride."
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Where powers are your retainers, and your words,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Domestics to you, serve your will as't please"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You tender more your person's honour than"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Your high profession spiritual: that again"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I do refuse you for my judge; and here,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Before you all, appeal unto the pope,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And to be judged by him."
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"The queen is obstinate,"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well."
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"She's going away."
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Call her again."
II,IV,Crier,"Katharine Queen of England, come into the court."
II,IV,GRIFFITH,"Madam, you are call'd back."
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on:"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I will not tarry; no, nor ever more"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Upon this business my appearance make"
II,IV,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In any of their courts."
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Go thy ways, Kate:"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"That man i' the world who shall report he has"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"A better wife, let him in nought be trusted,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Obeying in commanding, and thy parts"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"And, like her true nobility, she has"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Carried herself towards me."
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Most gracious sir,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In humblest manner I require your highness,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That it shall please you to declare, in hearing"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There must I be unloosed, although not there"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Did broach this business to your highness; or"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Laid any scruple in your way, which might"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Induce you to the question on't? or ever"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Have to you, but with thanks to God for such"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A royal lady, spake one the least word that might"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Be to the prejudice of her present state,"
II,IV,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Or touch of her good person?"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"My lord cardinal,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I free you from't. You are not to be taught"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"That you have many enemies, that know not"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Bark when their fellows do: by some of these"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"The queen is put in anger. You're excused:"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"But will you be more justified? You ever"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"The passages made toward it: on my honour,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I will be bold with time and your attention:"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"My conscience first received a tenderness,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Who had been hither sent on the debating"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Ere a determinate resolution, he,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I mean the bishop, did require a respite;"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Wherein he might the king his lord advertise"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Whether our daughter were legitimate,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"The region of my breast; which forced such way,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"That many mazed considerings did throng"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"And press'd in with this caution. First, methought"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"If it conceived a male child by me, should"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Do no more offices of life to't than"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"The grave does to the dead; for her male issue"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Or died where they were made, or shortly after"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Toward this remedy, whereupon we are"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Now present here together: that's to say,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I meant to rectify my conscience,--which"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"By all the reverend fathers of the land"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"And doctors learn'd: first I began in private"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"How under my oppression I did reek,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"When I first moved you."
II,IV,LINCOLN,"Very well, my liege."
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"How far you satisfied me."
II,IV,LINCOLN,"So please your highness,"
II,IV,LINCOLN,"The question did at first so stagger me,"
II,IV,LINCOLN,"Bearing a state of mighty moment in't"
II,IV,LINCOLN,"And consequence of dread, that I committed"
II,IV,LINCOLN,"The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;"
II,IV,LINCOLN,"And did entreat your highness to this course"
II,IV,LINCOLN,"Which you are running here."
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I then moved you,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"To make this present summons: unsolicited"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I left no reverend person in this court;"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"But by particular consent proceeded"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"For no dislike i' the world against the person"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"And kingly dignity, we are contented"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"To wear our mortal state to come with her,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Katharine our queen, before the primest creature"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"That's paragon'd o' the world."
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"So please your highness,"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"That we adjourn this court till further day:"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Meanwhile must be an earnest motion"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Made to the queen, to call back her appeal"
II,IV,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"She intends unto his holiness."
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome."
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"My comfort comes along. Break up the court:"
II,IV,KING HENRY VIII,"I say, set on."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Orpheus with his lute made trees,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And the mountain tops that freeze,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Bow themselves when he did sing:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To his music plants and flowers"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ever sprung; as sun and showers"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"There had made a lasting spring."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Every thing that heard him play,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Even the billows of the sea,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Hung their heads, and then lay by."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In sweet music is such art,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Killing care and grief of heart"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Fall asleep, or hearing, die."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"How now!"
III,I,Gentleman,"An't please your grace, the two great cardinals"
III,I,Gentleman,"Wait in the presence."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Would they speak with me?"
III,I,Gentleman,"They will'd me say so, madam."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Pray their graces"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To come near."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"What can be their business"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"But all hoods make not monks."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Peace to your highness!"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Your graces find me here part of a housewife,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I would be all, against the worst may happen."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"May it please you noble madam, to withdraw"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Into your private chamber, we shall give you"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The full cause of our coming."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Speak it here:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Deserves a corner: would all other women"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My lords, I care not, so much I am happy"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Above a number, if my actions"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Envy and base opinion set against 'em,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I know my life so even. If your business"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"serenissima,--"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"O, good my lord, no Latin;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I am not such a truant since my coming,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"As not to know the language I have lived in:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"suspicious;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The willing'st sin I ever yet committed"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"May be absolved in English."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Noble lady,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I am sorry my integrity should breed,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And service to his majesty and you,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"We come not by the way of accusation,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You have too much, good lady; but to know"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"How you stand minded in the weighty difference"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Between the king and you; and to deliver,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Like free and honest men, our just opinions"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And comforts to your cause."
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Most honour'd madam,"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Forgetting, like a good man your late censure"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Both of his truth and him, which was too far,"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"His service and his counsel."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"But how to make ye suddenly an answer,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And to such men of gravity and learning,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In truth, I know not. I was set at work"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Either for such men or such business."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"For her sake that I have been,--for I feel"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Let me have time and counsel for my cause:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Your hopes and friends are infinite."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In England"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"But little for my profit: can you think, lords,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That any Englishman dare give me counsel?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They that must weigh out my afflictions,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They that my trust must grow to, live not here:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They are, as all my other comforts, far hence"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In mine own country, lords."
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"I would your grace"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"How, sir?"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Put your main cause into the king's protection;"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Both for your honour better and your cause;"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"You'll part away disgraced."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"He tells you rightly."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That no king can corrupt."
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Your rage mistakes us."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I will not wish ye half my miseries;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Madam, this is a mere distraction;"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You turn the good we offer into envy."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And all such false professors! would you have me--"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"If you have any justice, any pity;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And all the fellowship I hold now with him"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Is only my obedience. What can happen"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To me above this wretchedness? all your studies"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Make me a curse like this."
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Your fears are worse."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Never yet branded with suspicion?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Have I with all my full affections"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Still met the king? loved him next heaven?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"obey'd him?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Almost forgot my prayers to content him?"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Bring me a constant woman to her husband,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And to that woman, when she has done most,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Yet will I add an honour, a great patience."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Madam, you wander from the good we aim at."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To give up willingly that noble title"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Your master wed me to: nothing but death"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Shall e'er divorce my dignities."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Pray, hear me."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Would I had never trod this English earth,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"What will become of me now, wretched lady!"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I am the most unhappy woman living."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I'll hang my head and perish."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"If your grace"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The way of our profession is against it:"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For goodness' sake, consider what you do;"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The hearts of princes kiss obedience,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"They swell, and grow as terrible as storms."
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know you have a gentle, noble temper,"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us"
III,I,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants."
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"As yours was put into you, ever casts"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"To trust us in your business, we are ready"
III,I,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"To use our utmost studies in your service."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"If I have used myself unmannerly;"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You know I am a woman, lacking wit"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"To make a seemly answer to such persons."
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Pray, do my service to his majesty:"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That little thought, when she set footing here,"
III,I,QUEEN KATHARINE,"She should have bought her dignities so dear."
III,II,NORFOLK,"If you will now unite in your complaints,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"And force them with a constancy, the cardinal"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Cannot stand under them: if you omit"
III,II,NORFOLK,"The offer of this time, I cannot promise"
III,II,NORFOLK,"But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"With these you bear already."
III,II,SURREY,"I am joyful"
III,II,SURREY,"To meet the least occasion that may give me"
III,II,SURREY,"Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,"
III,II,SURREY,"To be revenged on him."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Which of the peers"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Strangely neglected? when did he regard"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"The stamp of nobleness in any person"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Out of himself?"
III,II,Chamberlain,"My lords, you speak your pleasures:"
III,II,Chamberlain,"What he deserves of you and me I know;"
III,II,Chamberlain,"What we can do to him, though now the time"
III,II,Chamberlain,"Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot"
III,II,Chamberlain,"Bar his access to the king, never attempt"
III,II,Chamberlain,"Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft"
III,II,Chamberlain,"Over the king in's tongue."
III,II,NORFOLK,"O, fear him not;"
III,II,NORFOLK,"His spell in that is out: the king hath found"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Matter against him that for ever mars"
III,II,NORFOLK,"The honey of his language. No, he's settled,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Not to come off, in his displeasure."
III,II,SURREY,"Sir,"
III,II,SURREY,"I should be glad to hear such news as this"
III,II,SURREY,"Once every hour."
III,II,NORFOLK,"Believe it, this is true:"
III,II,NORFOLK,"In the divorce his contrary proceedings"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Are all unfolded wherein he appears"
III,II,NORFOLK,"As I would wish mine enemy."
III,II,SURREY,"How came"
III,II,SURREY,"His practises to light?"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Most strangely."
III,II,SURREY,"O, how, how?"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"It did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"My king is tangled in affection to"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'"
III,II,SURREY,"Has the king this?"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Believe it."
III,II,SURREY,"Will this work?"
III,II,Chamberlain,"The king in this perceives him, how he coasts"
III,II,Chamberlain,"And hedges his own way. But in this point"
III,II,Chamberlain,"All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic"
III,II,Chamberlain,"After his patient's death: the king already"
III,II,Chamberlain,"Hath married the fair lady."
III,II,SURREY,"Would he had!"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"May you be happy in your wish, my lord"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"For, I profess, you have it."
III,II,SURREY,"Now, all my joy"
III,II,SURREY,"Trace the conjunction!"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"My amen to't!"
III,II,NORFOLK,"All men's!"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"There's order given for her coronation:"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"She is a gallant creature, and complete"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"In it be memorised."
III,II,SURREY,"But, will the king"
III,II,SURREY,"Digest this letter of the cardinal's?"
III,II,SURREY,"The Lord forbid!"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Marry, amen!"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"No, no;"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"To second all his plot. I do assure you"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"The king cried Ha! at this."
III,II,Chamberlain,"Now, God incense him,"
III,II,Chamberlain,"And let him cry Ha! louder!"
III,II,NORFOLK,"But, my lord,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"When returns Cranmer?"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"He is return'd in his opinions; which"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Have satisfied the king for his divorce,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Together with all famous colleges"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"His second marriage shall be publish'd, and"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Her coronation. Katharine no more"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"And widow to Prince Arthur."
III,II,NORFOLK,"This same Cranmer's"
III,II,NORFOLK,"A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain"
III,II,NORFOLK,"In the king's business."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"He has; and we shall see him"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"For it an archbishop."
III,II,NORFOLK,"So I hear."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"'Tis so."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"The cardinal!"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Observe, observe, he's moody."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The packet, Cromwell."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Gave't you the king?"
III,II,CROMWELL,"To his own hand, in's bedchamber."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Presently"
III,II,CROMWELL,"He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,"
III,II,CROMWELL,"He did it with a serious mind; a heed"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Was in his countenance. You he bade"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Attend him here this morning."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Is he ready"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To come abroad?"
III,II,CROMWELL,"I think, by this he is."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Leave me awhile."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The French king's sister: he shall marry her."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!"
III,II,NORFOLK,"He's discontented."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"May be, he hears the king"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Does whet his anger to him."
III,II,SURREY,"Sharp enough,"
III,II,SURREY,"Lord, for thy justice!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"a knight's daughter,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And well deserving? yet I know her for"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And is his oracle."
III,II,NORFOLK,"He is vex'd at something."
III,II,SURREY,"I would 'twere something that would fret the string,"
III,II,SURREY,"The master-cord on's heart!"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"The king, the king!"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"What piles of wealth hath he accumulated"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To his own portion! and what expense by the hour"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Seems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Saw you the cardinal?"
III,II,NORFOLK,"My lord, we have"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Stood here observing him: some strange commotion"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Then lays his finger on his temple, straight"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts"
III,II,NORFOLK,"His eye against the moon: in most strange postures"
III,II,NORFOLK,"We have seen him set himself."
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"It may well be;"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Papers of state he sent me to peruse,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"As I required: and wot you what I found"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Possession of a subject."
III,II,NORFOLK,"It's heaven's will:"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Some spirit put this paper in the packet,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"To bless your eye withal."
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"If we did think"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"His contemplation were above the earth,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"His thinkings are below the moon, not worth"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"His serious considering."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Heaven forgive me!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Ever God bless your highness!"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Good my lord,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Of your best graces in your mind; the which"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"You were now running o'er: you have scarce time"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"I deem you an ill husband, and am glad"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To have you therein my companion."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Sir,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For holy offices I have a time; a time"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To think upon the part of business which"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I bear i' the state; and nature does require"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Her times of preservation, which perforce"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Must give my tendence to."
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"You have said well."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And ever may your highness yoke together,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"As I will lend you cause, my doing well"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"With my well saying!"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"'Tis well said again;"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"His said he did; and with his deed did crown"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"His word upon you. Since I had my office,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"I have kept you next my heart; have not alone"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Employ'd you where high profits might come home,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"But pared my present havings, to bestow"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"My bounties upon you."
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Have I not made you,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"If what I now pronounce you have found true:"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And, if you may confess it, say withal,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"If you are bound to us or no. What say you?"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My studied purposes requite; which went"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Have ever come too short of my desires,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Have been mine so that evermore they pointed"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To the good of your most sacred person and"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The profit of the state. For your great graces"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Which ever has and ever shall be growing,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Till death, that winter, kill it."
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Fairly answer'd;"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"A loyal and obedient subject is"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Therein illustrated: the honour of it"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"The foulness is the punishment. I presume"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"On you than any; so your hand and heart,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Your brain, and every function of your power,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"As 'twere in love's particular, be more"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To me, your friend, than any."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I do profess"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That for your highness' good I ever labour'd"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"More than mine own; that am, have, and will be--"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Though all the world should crack their duty to you,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And throw it from their soul; though perils did"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"As doth a rock against the chiding flood,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Should the approach of this wild river break,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And stand unshaken yours."
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"'Tis nobly spoken:"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And after, this: and then to breakfast with"
III,II,KING HENRY VIII,"What appetite you have."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What should this mean?"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"He parted frowning from me, as if ruin"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This paper has undone me: 'tis the account"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Made me put this main secret in the packet"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"No new device to beat this from his brains?"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The letter, as I live, with all the business"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And, from that full meridian of my glory,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I haste now to my setting: I shall fall"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Like a bright exhalation m the evening,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And no man see me more."
III,II,NORFOLK,"Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you"
III,II,NORFOLK,"To render up the great seal presently"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Into our hands; and to confine yourself"
III,II,NORFOLK,"To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Till you hear further from his highness."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Stay:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Authority so weighty."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Who dare cross 'em,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Till I find more than will or words to do it,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I mean your malice, know, officious lords,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I dare and must deny it. Now I feel"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Follow your envious courses, men of malice;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You ask with such a violence, the king,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?"
III,II,SURREY,"The king, that gave it."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"It must be himself, then."
III,II,SURREY,"Thou art a proud traitor, priest."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Proud lord, thou liest:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Within these forty hours Surrey durst better"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Have burnt that tongue than said so."
III,II,SURREY,"Thy ambition,"
III,II,SURREY,"Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land"
III,II,SURREY,"Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:"
III,II,SURREY,"The heads of all thy brother cardinals,"
III,II,SURREY,"With thee and all thy best parts bound together,"
III,II,SURREY,"Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!"
III,II,SURREY,"You sent me deputy for Ireland;"
III,II,SURREY,"Far from his succor, from the king, from all"
III,II,SURREY,"That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;"
III,II,SURREY,"Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,"
III,II,SURREY,"Absolved him with an axe."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This, and all else"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This talking lord can lay upon my credit,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I answer is most false. The duke by law"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Found his deserts: how innocent I was"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"From any private malice in his end,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"His noble jury and foul cause can witness."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You have as little honesty as honour,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That in the way of loyalty and truth"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Toward the king, my ever royal master,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And all that love his follies."
III,II,SURREY,"By my soul,"
III,II,SURREY,"Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou"
III,II,SURREY,"shouldst feel"
III,II,SURREY,"My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,"
III,II,SURREY,"Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?"
III,II,SURREY,"And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,"
III,II,SURREY,"To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,"
III,II,SURREY,"Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,"
III,II,SURREY,"And dare us with his cap like larks."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"All goodness"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Is poison to thy stomach."
III,II,SURREY,"Yes, that goodness"
III,II,SURREY,"Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,"
III,II,SURREY,"Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;"
III,II,SURREY,"The goodness of your intercepted packets"
III,II,SURREY,"You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,"
III,II,SURREY,"Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious."
III,II,SURREY,"My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,"
III,II,SURREY,"As you respect the common good, the state"
III,II,SURREY,"Of our despised nobility, our issues,"
III,II,SURREY,"Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,"
III,II,SURREY,"Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles"
III,II,SURREY,"Collected from his life. I'll startle you"
III,II,SURREY,"Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench"
III,II,SURREY,"Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"How much, methinks, I could despise this man,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"But that I am bound in charity against it!"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:"
III,II,NORFOLK,"But, thus much, they are foul ones."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"So much fairer"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And spotless shall mine innocence arise,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"When the king knows my truth."
III,II,SURREY,"This cannot save you:"
III,II,SURREY,"I thank my memory, I yet remember"
III,II,SURREY,"Some of these articles; and out they shall."
III,II,SURREY,"Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,"
III,II,SURREY,"You'll show a little honesty."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Speak on, sir;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I dare your worst objections: if I blush,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"It is to see a nobleman want manners."
III,II,SURREY,"I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!"
III,II,SURREY,"First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,"
III,II,SURREY,"You wrought to be a legate; by which power"
III,II,SURREY,"You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops."
III,II,NORFOLK,"Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else"
III,II,NORFOLK,"To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'"
III,II,NORFOLK,"Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king"
III,II,NORFOLK,"To be your servant."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Then that, without the knowledge"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Either of king or council, when you went"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"To carry into Flanders the great seal."
III,II,SURREY,"Item, you sent a large commission"
III,II,SURREY,"To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,"
III,II,SURREY,"Without the king's will or the state's allowance,"
III,II,SURREY,"A league between his highness and Ferrara."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"That, out of mere ambition, you have caused"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin."
III,II,SURREY,"Then that you have sent innumerable substance--"
III,II,SURREY,"By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--"
III,II,SURREY,"To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways"
III,II,SURREY,"You have for dignities; to the mere undoing"
III,II,SURREY,"Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;"
III,II,SURREY,"Which, since they are of you, and odious,"
III,II,SURREY,"I will not taint my mouth with."
III,II,Chamberlain,"O my lord,"
III,II,Chamberlain,"Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:"
III,II,Chamberlain,"His faults lie open to the laws; let them,"
III,II,Chamberlain,"Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him"
III,II,Chamberlain,"So little of his great self."
III,II,SURREY,"I forgive him."
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Because all those things you have done of late,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"By your power legatine, within this kingdom,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Fall into the compass of a praemunire,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"That therefore such a writ be sued against you;"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be"
III,II,SUFFOLK,"Out of the king's protection. This is my charge."
III,II,NORFOLK,"And so we'll leave you to your meditations"
III,II,NORFOLK,"How to live better. For your stubborn answer"
III,II,NORFOLK,"About the giving back the great seal to us,"
III,II,NORFOLK,"The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you."
III,II,NORFOLK,"So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"So farewell to the little good you bear me."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This many summers in a sea of glory,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"At length broke under me and now has left me,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Weary and old with service, to the mercy"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"More pangs and fears than wars or women have:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Never to hope again."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Why, how now, Cromwell!"
III,II,CROMWELL,"I have no power to speak, sir."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What, amazed"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I am fall'n indeed."
III,II,CROMWELL,"How does your grace?"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Why, well;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know myself now; and I feel within me"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A peace above all earthly dignities,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A load would sink a navy, too much honour:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!"
III,II,CROMWELL,"I am glad your grace has made that right use of it."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To endure more miseries and greater far"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What news abroad?"
III,II,CROMWELL,"The heaviest and the worst"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Is your displeasure with the king."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"God bless him!"
III,II,CROMWELL,"The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Lord chancellor in your place."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That's somewhat sudden:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"But he's a learned man. May he continue"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Long in his highness' favour, and do justice"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?"
III,II,CROMWELL,"That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That's news indeed."
III,II,CROMWELL,"Last, that the Lady Anne,"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,"
III,II,CROMWELL,"This day was view'd in open as his queen,"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Going to chapel; and the voice is now"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Only about her coronation."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The king has gone beyond me: all my glories"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In that one woman I have lost for ever:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Or gild again the noble troops that waited"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To be thy lord and master: seek the king;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Some little memory of me will stir him--"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know his noble nature--not to let"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Neglect him not; make use now, and provide"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For thine own future safety."
III,II,CROMWELL,"O my lord,"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego"
III,II,CROMWELL,"So good, so noble and so true a master?"
III,II,CROMWELL,"Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,"
III,II,CROMWELL,"With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord."
III,II,CROMWELL,"The king shall have my service: but my prayers"
III,II,CROMWELL,"For ever and for ever shall be yours."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Corruption wins not more than honesty."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"O Cromwell,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And,--prithee, lead me in:"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There take an inventory of all I have,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And my integrity to heaven, is all"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Had I but served my God with half the zeal"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I served my king, he would not in mine age"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Have left me naked to mine enemies."
III,II,CROMWELL,"Good sir, have patience."
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"So I have. Farewell"
III,II,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"You're well met once again."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"So are you."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"You come to take your stand here, and behold"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"This, general joy."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"'Tis well: the citizens,"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"In celebration of this day with shows,"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Pageants and sights of honour."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Never greater,"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"May I be bold to ask at what that contains,"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"That paper in your hand?"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Yes; 'tis the list"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Of those that claim their offices this day"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"By custom of the coronation."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"I should have been beholding to your paper."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"The princess dowager? how goes her business?"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"That I can tell you too. The Archbishop"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Of Canterbury, accompanied with other"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Learned and reverend fathers of his order,"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"And, to be short, for not appearance and"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"The king's late scruple, by the main assent"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Of all these learned men she was divorced,"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"And the late marriage made of none effect"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Where she remains now sick."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Alas, good lady!"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"A royal train, believe me. These I know:"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Who's that that bears the sceptre?"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Marquess Dorset:"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"A bold brave gentleman. That should be"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"The Duke of Suffolk?"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"'Tis the same: high-steward."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"And that my Lord of Norfolk?"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Yes;"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Heaven bless thee!"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Our king has all the Indies in his arms,"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"And more and richer, when he strains that lady:"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"I cannot blame his conscience."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"They that bear"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"The cloth of honour over her, are four barons"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Of the Cinque-ports."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Those men are happy; and so are all are near her."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"I take it, she that carries up the train"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"It is; and all the rest are countesses."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"And sometimes falling ones."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"No more of that."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"With the mere rankness of their joy."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"You saw"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"The ceremony?"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"That I did."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"How was it?"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Well worth the seeing."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Good sir, speak it to us."
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"As well as I am able. The rich stream"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"To a prepared place in the choir, fell off"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"A distance from her; while her grace sat down"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"In a rich chair of state, opposing freely"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"The beauty of her person to the people."
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"That ever lay by man: which when the people"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Had the full view of, such a noise arose"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"I never saw before. Great-bellied women,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"That had not half a week to go, like rams"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"In the old time of war, would shake the press,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"So strangely in one piece."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"But, what follow'd?"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"At length her grace rose, and with modest paces"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly."
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"When by the Archbishop of Canterbury"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"She had all the royal makings of a queen;"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"With all the choicest music of the kingdom,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"And with the same full state paced back again"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"To York-place, where the feast is held."
IV,I,First Gentleman,"Sir,"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"You must no more call it York-place, that's past;"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:"
IV,I,First Gentleman,"'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall."
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"I know it;"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Is fresh about me."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"What two reverend bishops"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Were those that went on each side of the queen?"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"The other, London."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"He of Winchester"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,"
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"The virtuous Cranmer."
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"All the land knows that:"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"Who may that be, I pray you?"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Thomas Cromwell;"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"A man in much esteem with the king, and truly"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"A worthy friend. The king has made him master"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"O' the jewel house,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"And one, already, of the privy council."
IV,I,Second Gentleman,"He will deserve more."
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Yes, without all doubt."
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"Something I can command. As I walk thither,"
IV,I,Third Gentleman,"I'll tell ye more."
IV,I,Both,"You may command us, sir."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"How does your grace?"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"O Griffith, sick to death!"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Yes, madam; but I think your grace,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"If well, he stepp'd before me, happily"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"For my example."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Well, the voice goes, madam:"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"For after the stout Earl Northumberland"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"He could not sit his mule."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Alas, poor man!"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"With all his covent, honourably received him;"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"An old man, broken with the storms of state,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Give him a little earth for charity!'"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"About the hour of eight, which he himself"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"He gave his honours to the world again,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"And yet with charity. He was a man"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"His own opinion was his law: i' the presence"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"He would say untruths; and be ever double"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Both in his words and meaning: he was never,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"His promises were, as he then was, mighty;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"But his performance, as he is now, nothing:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Of his own body he was ill, and gave"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"The clergy in example."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Noble madam,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"We write in water. May it please your highness"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"To hear me speak his good now?"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Yes, good Griffith;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I were malicious else."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"This cardinal,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"But to those men that sought him sweet as summer."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"And though he were unsatisfied in getting,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"He was most princely: ever witness for him"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"So excellent in art, and still so rising,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"For then, and not till then, he felt himself,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"And found the blessedness of being little:"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"And, to add greater honours to his age"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Than man could give him, he died fearing God."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"After my death I wish no other herald,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"No other speaker of my living actions,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"To keep mine honour from corruption,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"But such an honest chronicler as Griffith."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"With thy religious truth and modesty,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Cause the musicians play me that sad note"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"On that celestial harmony I go to."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Madam, we are here."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"It is not you I call for:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Saw ye none enter since I slept?"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"None, madam."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"They promised me eternal happiness;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly."
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Possess your fancy."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Bid the music leave,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"They are harsh and heavy to me."
IV,II,PATIENCE,"Do you note"
IV,II,PATIENCE,"How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?"
IV,II,PATIENCE,"How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,"
IV,II,PATIENCE,"And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"She is going, wench: pray, pray."
IV,II,PATIENCE,"Heaven comfort her!"
IV,II,Messenger,"An't like your grace,--"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"You are a saucy fellow:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Deserve we no more reverence?"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"You are to blame,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,"
IV,II,GRIFFITH,"To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel."
IV,II,Messenger,"I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;"
IV,II,Messenger,"My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying"
IV,II,Messenger,"A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Let me ne'er see again."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"If my sight fail not,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"My royal nephew, and your name Capucius."
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"Madam, the same; your servant."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"O, my lord,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"The times and titles now are alter'd strangely"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"What is your pleasure with me?"
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"Noble lady,"
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"First mine own service to your grace; the next,"
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"The king's request that I would visit you;"
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me"
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"Sends you his princely commendations,"
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"And heartily entreats you take good comfort."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"'Tis like a pardon after execution:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"How does his highness?"
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"Madam, in good health."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"So may he ever do! and ever flourish,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I caused you write, yet sent away?"
IV,II,PATIENCE,"No, madam."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"This to my lord the king."
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"Most willing, madam."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"In which I have commended to his goodness"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"She is young, and of a noble modest nature,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I hope she will deserve well,--and a little"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Is, that his noble grace would have some pity"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Upon my wretched women, that so long"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Of which there is not one, I dare avow,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"And now I should not lie, but will deserve"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"For virtue and true beauty of the soul,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"For honesty and decent carriage,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"A right good husband, let him be a noble"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"But poverty could never draw 'em from me;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"And something over to remember me by:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"And able means, we had not parted thus."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"By that you love the dearest in this world,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"To do me this last right."
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"By heaven, I will,"
IV,II,CAPUCIUS,"Or let me lose the fashion of a man!"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I thank you, honest lord. Remember me"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"In all humility unto his highness:"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Say his long trouble now is passing"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Let me be used with honour: strew me over"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"With maiden flowers, that all the world may know"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like"
IV,II,KATHARINE,"A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me."
IV,II,KATHARINE,"I can no more."
V,I,GARDINER,"It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?"
V,I,Boy,"It hath struck."
V,I,GARDINER,"These should be hours for necessities,"
V,I,GARDINER,"Not for delights; times to repair our nature"
V,I,GARDINER,"With comforting repose, and not for us"
V,I,GARDINER,"To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!"
V,I,GARDINER,"Whither so late?"
V,I,LOVELL,"Came you from the king, my lord"
V,I,GARDINER,"I did, Sir Thomas: and left him at primero"
V,I,GARDINER,"With the Duke of Suffolk."
V,I,LOVELL,"I must to him too,"
V,I,LOVELL,"Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave."
V,I,GARDINER,"Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?"
V,I,GARDINER,"It seems you are in haste: an if there be"
V,I,GARDINER,"No great offence belongs to't, give your friend"
V,I,GARDINER,"Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,"
V,I,GARDINER,"As they say spirits do, at midnight, have"
V,I,GARDINER,"In them a wilder nature than the business"
V,I,GARDINER,"That seeks dispatch by day."
V,I,LOVELL,"My lord, I love you;"
V,I,LOVELL,"And durst commend a secret to your ear"
V,I,LOVELL,"Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,"
V,I,LOVELL,"They say, in great extremity; and fear'd"
V,I,LOVELL,"She'll with the labour end."
V,I,GARDINER,"The fruit she goes with"
V,I,GARDINER,"I pray for heartily, that it may find"
V,I,GARDINER,"Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,"
V,I,GARDINER,"I wish it grubb'd up now."
V,I,LOVELL,"Methinks I could"
V,I,LOVELL,"Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says"
V,I,LOVELL,"She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does"
V,I,LOVELL,"Deserve our better wishes."
V,I,GARDINER,"But, sir, sir,"
V,I,GARDINER,"Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman"
V,I,GARDINER,"Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;"
V,I,GARDINER,"And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,"
V,I,GARDINER,"'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,"
V,I,GARDINER,"Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,"
V,I,GARDINER,"Sleep in their graves."
V,I,LOVELL,"Now, sir, you speak of two"
V,I,LOVELL,"The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,"
V,I,LOVELL,"Beside that of the jewel house, is made master"
V,I,LOVELL,"O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,"
V,I,LOVELL,"Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,"
V,I,LOVELL,"With which the time will load him. The archbishop"
V,I,LOVELL,"Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak"
V,I,LOVELL,"One syllable against him?"
V,I,GARDINER,"Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,"
V,I,GARDINER,"There are that dare; and I myself have ventured"
V,I,GARDINER,"To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,"
V,I,GARDINER,"Sir, I may tell it you, I think I have"
V,I,GARDINER,"Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is,"
V,I,GARDINER,"For so I know he is, they know he is,"
V,I,GARDINER,"A most arch heretic, a pestilence"
V,I,GARDINER,"That does infect the land: with which they moved"
V,I,GARDINER,"Have broken with the king; who hath so far"
V,I,GARDINER,"Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace"
V,I,GARDINER,"And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs"
V,I,GARDINER,"Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded"
V,I,GARDINER,"To-morrow morning to the council-board"
V,I,GARDINER,"He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,"
V,I,GARDINER,"And we must root him out. From your affairs"
V,I,GARDINER,"I hinder you too long: good night, Sir Thomas."
V,I,LOVELL,"Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Charles, I will play no more tonight;"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me."
V,I,SUFFOLK,"Sir, I did never win of you before."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"But little, Charles;"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?"
V,I,LOVELL,"I could not personally deliver to her"
V,I,LOVELL,"What you commanded me, but by her woman"
V,I,LOVELL,"I sent your message; who return'd her thanks"
V,I,LOVELL,"In the great'st humbleness, and desired your highness"
V,I,LOVELL,"Most heartily to pray for her."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"What say'st thou, ha?"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"To pray for her? what, is she crying out?"
V,I,LOVELL,"So said her woman; and that her sufferance made"
V,I,LOVELL,"Almost each pang a death."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Alas, good lady!"
V,I,SUFFOLK,"God safely quit her of her burthen, and"
V,I,SUFFOLK,"With gentle travail, to the gladding of"
V,I,SUFFOLK,"Your highness with an heir!"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"'Tis midnight, Charles;"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"For I must think of that which company"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Would not be friendly to."
V,I,SUFFOLK,"I wish your highness"
V,I,SUFFOLK,"A quiet night; and my good mistress will"
V,I,SUFFOLK,"Remember in my prayers."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Charles, good night."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Well, sir, what follows?"
V,I,DENNY,"Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,"
V,I,DENNY,"As you commanded me."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Ha! Canterbury?"
V,I,DENNY,"Ay, my good lord."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"'Tis true: where is he, Denny?"
V,I,DENNY,"He attends your highness' pleasure."
V,I,LOVELL,"I am happily come hither."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Avoid the gallery."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!"
V,I,CRANMER,"I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?"
V,I,CRANMER,"'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"How now, my lord! you desire to know"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Wherefore I sent for you."
V,I,CRANMER,"To attend your highness' pleasure."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Pray you, arise,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Come, you and I must walk a turn together;"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"And am right sorry to repeat what follows"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"I have, and most unwillingly, of late"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Have moved us and our council, that you shall"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"This morning come before us; where, I know,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"But that, till further trial in those charges"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Which will require your answer, you must take"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Your patience to you, and be well contented"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Would come against you."
V,I,CRANMER,"I humbly thank your highness;"
V,I,CRANMER,"And am right glad to catch this good occasion"
V,I,CRANMER,"Most throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff"
V,I,CRANMER,"And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,"
V,I,CRANMER,"There's none stands under more calumnious tongues"
V,I,CRANMER,"Than I myself, poor man."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Stand up, good Canterbury:"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"You would have given me your petition, that"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"I should have ta'en some pains to bring together"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Without indurance, further."
V,I,CRANMER,"Most dread liege,"
V,I,CRANMER,"The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:"
V,I,CRANMER,"If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,"
V,I,CRANMER,"Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,"
V,I,CRANMER,"Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing"
V,I,CRANMER,"What can be said against me."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Know you not"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Your enemies are many, and not small; their practises"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Must bear the same proportion; and not ever"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"The justice and the truth o' the question carries"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"To swear against you? such things have been done."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"You are potently opposed; and with a malice"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"You take a precipice for no leap of danger,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"And woo your own destruction."
V,I,CRANMER,"God and your majesty"
V,I,CRANMER,"Protect mine innocence, or I fall into"
V,I,CRANMER,"The trap is laid for me!"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Be of good cheer;"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"They shall no more prevail than we give way to."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Keep comfort to you; and this morning see"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"You do appear before them: if they shall chance,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"In charging you with matters, to commit you,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"The best persuasions to the contrary"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Fail not to use, and with what vehemency"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Will render you no remedy, this ring"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Deliver them, and your appeal to us"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother!"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"I swear he is true--hearted; and a soul"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"And do as I have bid you."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"He has strangled"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"His language in his tears."
V,I,Old Lady,"I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring"
V,I,Old Lady,"Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels"
V,I,Old Lady,"Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person"
V,I,Old Lady,"Under their blessed wings!"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Now, by thy looks"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Say, ay; and of a boy."
V,I,Old Lady,"Ay, ay, my liege;"
V,I,Old Lady,"And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven"
V,I,Old Lady,"Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,"
V,I,Old Lady,"Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen"
V,I,Old Lady,"Desires your visitation, and to be"
V,I,Old Lady,"Acquainted with this stranger 'tis as like you"
V,I,Old Lady,"As cherry is to cherry."
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Lovell!"
V,I,LOVELL,"Sir?"
V,I,KING HENRY VIII,"Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen."
V,I,Old Lady,"An hundred marks! By this light, I'll ha' more."
V,I,Old Lady,"An ordinary groom is for such payment."
V,I,Old Lady,"I will have more, or scold it out of him."
V,I,Old Lady,"Said I for this, the girl was like to him?"
V,I,Old Lady,"I will have more, or else unsay't; and now,"
V,I,Old Lady,"While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue."
V,II,CRANMER,"I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,"
V,II,CRANMER,"That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me"
V,II,CRANMER,"To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!"
V,II,CRANMER,"Who waits there? Sure, you know me?"
V,II,Keeper,"Yes, my lord;"
V,II,Keeper,"But yet I cannot help you."
V,II,CRANMER,"Why?"
V,II,Keeper,"Your grace must wait till you be call'd for."
V,II,CRANMER,"So."
V,II,DOCTOR BUTTS,"I came this way so happily: the king"
V,II,DOCTOR BUTTS,"Shall understand it presently."
V,II,CRANMER,"The king's physician: as he pass'd along,"
V,II,CRANMER,"How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!"
V,II,CRANMER,"Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain,"
V,II,CRANMER,"This is of purpose laid by some that hate me--"
V,II,CRANMER,"God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice--"
V,II,CRANMER,"To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me"
V,II,CRANMER,"Wait else at door, a fellow-counsellor,"
V,II,CRANMER,"'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures"
V,II,CRANMER,"Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience."
V,II,DOCTOR BUTTS,"I'll show your grace the strangest sight--"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"What's that, Butts?"
V,II,DOCTOR BUTTS,"I think your highness saw this many a day."
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Body o' me, where is it?"
V,II,DOCTOR BUTTS,"There, my lord:"
V,II,DOCTOR BUTTS,"The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;"
V,II,DOCTOR BUTTS,"Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,"
V,II,DOCTOR BUTTS,"Pages, and footboys."
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Ha! 'tis he, indeed:"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Is this the honour they do one another?"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"They had parted so much honesty among 'em"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"At least, good manners, as not thus to suffer"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"A man of his place, and so near our favour,"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"And at the door too, like a post with packets."
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:"
V,II,KING HENRY VIII,"We shall hear more anon."
V,III,Chancellor,"Speak to the business, master-secretary:"
V,III,Chancellor,"Why are we met in council?"
V,III,CROMWELL,"Please your honours,"
V,III,CROMWELL,"The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury."
V,III,GARDINER,"Has he had knowledge of it?"
V,III,CROMWELL,"Yes."
V,III,NORFOLK,"Who waits there?"
V,III,Keeper,"Without, my noble lords?"
V,III,GARDINER,"Yes."
V,III,Keeper,"My lord archbishop;"
V,III,Keeper,"And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures."
V,III,Chancellor,"Let him come in."
V,III,Keeper,"Your grace may enter now."
V,III,Chancellor,"My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry"
V,III,Chancellor,"To sit here at this present, and behold"
V,III,Chancellor,"That chair stand empty: but we all are men,"
V,III,Chancellor,"In our own natures frail, and capable"
V,III,Chancellor,"Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty"
V,III,Chancellor,"And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,"
V,III,Chancellor,"Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,"
V,III,Chancellor,"Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling"
V,III,Chancellor,"The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,"
V,III,Chancellor,"For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,"
V,III,Chancellor,"Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,"
V,III,Chancellor,"And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious."
V,III,GARDINER,"Which reformation must be sudden too,"
V,III,GARDINER,"My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses"
V,III,GARDINER,"Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,"
V,III,GARDINER,"But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,"
V,III,GARDINER,"Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,"
V,III,GARDINER,"Out of our easiness and childish pity"
V,III,GARDINER,"To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,"
V,III,GARDINER,"Farewell all physic: and what follows then?"
V,III,GARDINER,"Commotions, uproars, with a general taint"
V,III,GARDINER,"Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,"
V,III,GARDINER,"The upper Germany, can dearly witness,"
V,III,GARDINER,"Yet freshly pitied in our memories."
V,III,CRANMER,"My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress"
V,III,CRANMER,"Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,"
V,III,CRANMER,"And with no little study, that my teaching"
V,III,CRANMER,"And the strong course of my authority"
V,III,CRANMER,"Might go one way, and safely; and the end"
V,III,CRANMER,"Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,"
V,III,CRANMER,"I speak it with a single heart, my lords,"
V,III,CRANMER,"A man that more detests, more stirs against,"
V,III,CRANMER,"Both in his private conscience and his place,"
V,III,CRANMER,"Defacers of a public peace, than I do."
V,III,CRANMER,"Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart"
V,III,CRANMER,"With less allegiance in it! Men that make"
V,III,CRANMER,"Envy and crooked malice nourishment"
V,III,CRANMER,"Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,"
V,III,CRANMER,"That, in this case of justice, my accusers,"
V,III,CRANMER,"Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,"
V,III,CRANMER,"And freely urge against me."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"Nay, my lord,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"That cannot be: you are a counsellor,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you."
V,III,GARDINER,"My lord, because we have business of more moment,"
V,III,GARDINER,"We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,"
V,III,GARDINER,"And our consent, for better trial of you,"
V,III,GARDINER,"From hence you be committed to the Tower;"
V,III,GARDINER,"Where, being but a private man again,"
V,III,GARDINER,"You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,"
V,III,GARDINER,"More than, I fear, you are provided for."
V,III,CRANMER,"Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;"
V,III,CRANMER,"You are always my good friend; if your will pass,"
V,III,CRANMER,"I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,"
V,III,CRANMER,"You are so merciful: I see your end;"
V,III,CRANMER,"'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,"
V,III,CRANMER,"Become a churchman better than ambition:"
V,III,CRANMER,"Win straying souls with modesty again,"
V,III,CRANMER,"Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,"
V,III,CRANMER,"Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,"
V,III,CRANMER,"I make as little doubt, as you do conscience"
V,III,CRANMER,"In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,"
V,III,CRANMER,"But reverence to your calling makes me modest."
V,III,GARDINER,"My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,"
V,III,GARDINER,"That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,"
V,III,GARDINER,"To men that understand you, words and weakness."
V,III,CROMWELL,"My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,"
V,III,CROMWELL,"By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,"
V,III,CROMWELL,"However faulty, yet should find respect"
V,III,CROMWELL,"For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty"
V,III,CROMWELL,"To load a falling man."
V,III,GARDINER,"Good master secretary,"
V,III,GARDINER,"I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst"
V,III,GARDINER,"Of all this table, say so."
V,III,CROMWELL,"Why, my lord?"
V,III,GARDINER,"Do not I know you for a favourer"
V,III,GARDINER,"Of this new sect? ye are not sound."
V,III,CROMWELL,"Not sound?"
V,III,GARDINER,"Not sound, I say."
V,III,CROMWELL,"Would you were half so honest!"
V,III,CROMWELL,"Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears."
V,III,GARDINER,"I shall remember this bold language."
V,III,CROMWELL,"Do."
V,III,CROMWELL,"Remember your bold life too."
V,III,Chancellor,"This is too much;"
V,III,Chancellor,"Forbear, for shame, my lords."
V,III,GARDINER,"I have done."
V,III,CROMWELL,"And I."
V,III,Chancellor,"Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,"
V,III,Chancellor,"I take it, by all voices, that forthwith"
V,III,Chancellor,"You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;"
V,III,Chancellor,"There to remain till the king's further pleasure"
V,III,Chancellor,"Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?"
V,III,All,"We are."
V,III,CRANMER,"Is there no other way of mercy,"
V,III,CRANMER,"But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?"
V,III,GARDINER,"What other"
V,III,GARDINER,"Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome."
V,III,GARDINER,"Let some o' the guard be ready there."
V,III,CRANMER,"For me?"
V,III,CRANMER,"Must I go like a traitor thither?"
V,III,GARDINER,"Receive him,"
V,III,GARDINER,"And see him safe i' the Tower."
V,III,CRANMER,"Stay, good my lords,"
V,III,CRANMER,"I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;"
V,III,CRANMER,"By virtue of that ring, I take my cause"
V,III,CRANMER,"Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it"
V,III,CRANMER,"To a most noble judge, the king my master."
V,III,Chamberlain,"This is the king's ring."
V,III,SURREY,"'Tis no counterfeit."
V,III,SUFFOLK,"'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,"
V,III,SUFFOLK,"'Twould fall upon ourselves."
V,III,NORFOLK,"Do you think, my lords,"
V,III,NORFOLK,"The king will suffer but the little finger"
V,III,NORFOLK,"Of this man to be vex'd?"
V,III,Chancellor,"'Tis now too certain:"
V,III,Chancellor,"How much more is his life in value with him?"
V,III,Chancellor,"Would I were fairly out on't!"
V,III,CROMWELL,"My mind gave me,"
V,III,CROMWELL,"In seeking tales and informations"
V,III,CROMWELL,"Against this man, whose honesty the devil"
V,III,CROMWELL,"And his disciples only envy at,"
V,III,CROMWELL,"Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!"
V,III,GARDINER,"Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven"
V,III,GARDINER,"In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;"
V,III,GARDINER,"Not only good and wise, but most religious:"
V,III,GARDINER,"One that, in all obedience, makes the church"
V,III,GARDINER,"The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen"
V,III,GARDINER,"That holy duty, out of dear respect,"
V,III,GARDINER,"His royal self in judgment comes to hear"
V,III,GARDINER,"The cause betwixt her and this great offender."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"You were ever good at sudden commendations,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"They are too thin and bare to hide offences."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"By all that's holy, he had better starve"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Than but once think this place becomes thee not."
V,III,SURREY,"May it please your grace,--"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"No, sir, it does not please me."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"I had thought I had had men of some understanding"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"And wisdom of my council; but I find none."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"At chamber--door? and one as great as you are?"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Power as he was a counsellor to try him,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"More out of malice than integrity,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Which ye shall never have while I live."
V,III,Chancellor,"Thus far,"
V,III,Chancellor,"My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace"
V,III,Chancellor,"To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed"
V,III,Chancellor,"Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,"
V,III,Chancellor,"If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,"
V,III,Chancellor,"And fair purgation to the world, than malice,"
V,III,Chancellor,"I'm sure, in me."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Well, well, my lords, respect him;"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"I will say thus much for him, if a prince"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"May be beholding to a subject, I"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Am, for his love and service, so to him."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Canterbury,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"I have a suit which you must not deny me;"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"You must be godfather, and answer for her."
V,III,CRANMER,"The greatest monarch now alive may glory"
V,III,CRANMER,"In such an honour: how may I deserve it"
V,III,CRANMER,"That am a poor and humble subject to you?"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons: you"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"shall have two noble partners with you; the old"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"these please you?"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Embrace and love this man."
V,III,GARDINER,"With a true heart"
V,III,GARDINER,"And brother-love I do it."
V,III,CRANMER,"And let heaven"
V,III,CRANMER,"Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"The common voice, I see, is verified"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Of thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"To have this young one made a Christian."
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;"
V,III,KING HENRY VIII,"So I grow stronger, you more honour gain."
V,IV,Porter,"You'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do you"
V,IV,Porter,"take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,"
V,IV,Porter,"leave your gaping."
V,IV,Porter,"Good master porter, I belong to the larder."
V,IV,Porter,"Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! is"
V,IV,Porter,"this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree"
V,IV,Porter,"staves, and strong ones: these are but switches to"
V,IV,Porter,"'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing"
V,IV,Porter,"christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,"
V,IV,Porter,"you rude rascals?"
V,IV,Man,"Pray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible--"
V,IV,Man,"Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--"
V,IV,Man,"To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep"
V,IV,Man,"On May-day morning; which will never be:"
V,IV,Man,"We may as well push against Powle's, as stir em."
V,IV,Porter,"How got they in, and be hang'd?"
V,IV,Man,"Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?"
V,IV,Man,"As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--"
V,IV,Man,"You see the poor remainder--could distribute,"
V,IV,Man,"I made no spare, sir."
V,IV,Porter,"You did nothing, sir."
V,IV,Man,"I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,"
V,IV,Man,"To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any"
V,IV,Man,"That had a head to hit, either young or old,"
V,IV,Man,"He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,"
V,IV,Man,"Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again"
V,IV,Man,"And that I would not for a cow, God save her!"
V,IV,Man,"Do you hear, master porter?"
V,IV,Porter,"I shall be with you presently, good master puppy."
V,IV,Porter,"Keep the door close, sirrah."
V,IV,Man,"What would you have me do?"
V,IV,Porter,"What should you do, but knock 'em down by the"
V,IV,Porter,"dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have"
V,IV,Porter,"we some strange Indian with the great tool come to"
V,IV,Porter,"court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a"
V,IV,Porter,"fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian"
V,IV,Porter,"conscience, this one christening will beget a"
V,IV,Porter,"thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together."
V,IV,Man,"The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a"
V,IV,Man,"fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a"
V,IV,Man,"brazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty"
V,IV,Man,"of the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand"
V,IV,Man,"about him are under the line, they need no other"
V,IV,Man,"penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on"
V,IV,Man,"the head, and three times was his nose discharged"
V,IV,Man,"against me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to"
V,IV,Man,"blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small"
V,IV,Man,"wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked"
V,IV,Man,"porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a"
V,IV,Man,"combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,"
V,IV,Man,"and hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when I"
V,IV,Man,"might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to"
V,IV,Man,"her succor, which were the hope o' the Strand, where"
V,IV,Man,"she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my"
V,IV,Man,"place: at length they came to the broom-staff to"
V,IV,Man,"me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of"
V,IV,Man,"boys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower"
V,IV,Man,"of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,"
V,IV,Man,"and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst"
V,IV,Man,"'em, I think, surely."
V,IV,Porter,"These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,"
V,IV,Porter,"and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but"
V,IV,Porter,"the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of"
V,IV,Porter,"Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure."
V,IV,Porter,"I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they"
V,IV,Porter,"are like to dance these three days; besides the"
V,IV,Porter,"running banquet of two beadles that is to come."
V,IV,Chamberlain,"Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"There's a trim rabble let in: are all these"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"When they pass back from the christening."
V,IV,Porter,"An't please"
V,IV,Porter,"your honour,"
V,IV,Porter,"We are but men; and what so many may do,"
V,IV,Porter,"Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:"
V,IV,Porter,"An army cannot rule 'em."
V,IV,Chamberlain,"As I live,"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"They're come already from the christening:"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"Go, break among the press, and find a way out"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find"
V,IV,Chamberlain,"A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months."
V,IV,Porter,"Make way there for the princess."
V,IV,Man,"You great fellow,"
V,IV,Man,"Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache."
V,IV,Porter,"You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;"
V,IV,Porter,"I'll peck you o'er the pales else."
V,V,Garter,"Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous"
V,V,Garter,"life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty"
V,V,Garter,"princess of England, Elizabeth!"
V,V,CRANMER,"My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:"
V,V,CRANMER,"All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,"
V,V,CRANMER,"Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,"
V,V,CRANMER,"May hourly fall upon ye!"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"Thank you, good lord archbishop:"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"What is her name?"
V,V,CRANMER,"Elizabeth."
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"Stand up, lord."
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"Into whose hand I give thy life."
V,V,CRANMER,"Amen."
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"When she has so much English."
V,V,CRANMER,"Let me speak, sir,"
V,V,CRANMER,"For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter"
V,V,CRANMER,"Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth."
V,V,CRANMER,"This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--"
V,V,CRANMER,"Though in her cradle, yet now promises"
V,V,CRANMER,"Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,"
V,V,CRANMER,"Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--"
V,V,CRANMER,"But few now living can behold that goodness--"
V,V,CRANMER,"A pattern to all princes living with her,"
V,V,CRANMER,"And all that shall succeed: Saba was never"
V,V,CRANMER,"More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue"
V,V,CRANMER,"Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,"
V,V,CRANMER,"That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,"
V,V,CRANMER,"With all the virtues that attend the good,"
V,V,CRANMER,"Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,"
V,V,CRANMER,"Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:"
V,V,CRANMER,"She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;"
V,V,CRANMER,"Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,"
V,V,CRANMER,"And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:"
V,V,CRANMER,"In her days every man shall eat in safety,"
V,V,CRANMER,"Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing"
V,V,CRANMER,"The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:"
V,V,CRANMER,"God shall be truly known; and those about her"
V,V,CRANMER,"From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,"
V,V,CRANMER,"And by those claim their greatness, not by blood."
V,V,CRANMER,"Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when"
V,V,CRANMER,"The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,"
V,V,CRANMER,"Her ashes new create another heir,"
V,V,CRANMER,"As great in admiration as herself;"
V,V,CRANMER,"So shall she leave her blessedness to one,"
V,V,CRANMER,"When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,"
V,V,CRANMER,"Who from the sacred ashes of her honour"
V,V,CRANMER,"Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,"
V,V,CRANMER,"And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,"
V,V,CRANMER,"That were the servants to this chosen infant,"
V,V,CRANMER,"Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:"
V,V,CRANMER,"Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,"
V,V,CRANMER,"His honour and the greatness of his name"
V,V,CRANMER,"Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,"
V,V,CRANMER,"And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches"
V,V,CRANMER,"To all the plains about him: our children's children"
V,V,CRANMER,"Shall see this, and bless heaven."
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"Thou speakest wonders."
V,V,CRANMER,"She shall be, to the happiness of England,"
V,V,CRANMER,"An aged princess; many days shall see her,"
V,V,CRANMER,"And yet no day without a deed to crown it."
V,V,CRANMER,"Would I had known no more! but she must die,"
V,V,CRANMER,"She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,"
V,V,CRANMER,"A most unspotted lily shall she pass"
V,V,CRANMER,"To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her."
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"O lord archbishop,"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"Thou hast made me now a man! never, before"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"This happy child, did I get any thing:"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"That when I am in heaven I shall desire"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"To see what this child does, and praise my Maker."
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"And your good brethren, I am much beholding;"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"I have received much honour by your presence,"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"She will be sick else. This day, no man think"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"Has business at his house; for all shall stay:"
V,V,KING HENRY VIII,"This little one shall make it holiday."
