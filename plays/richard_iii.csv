I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Now is the winter of our discontent"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Made glorious summer by this sun of York;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"In the deep bosom of the ocean buried."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Our dreadful marches to delightful measures."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And now, instead of mounting barded steeds"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"To the lascivious pleasing of a lute."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And that so lamely and unfashionable"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Have no delight to pass away the time,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Unless to spy my shadow in the sun"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And descant on mine own deformity:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"To entertain these fair well-spoken days,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"I am determined to prove a villain"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And hate the idle pleasures of these days."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"To set my brother Clarence and the king"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"In deadly hate the one against the other:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And if King Edward be as true and just"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"As I am subtle, false and treacherous,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"About a prophecy, which says that 'G'"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence comes."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, good day; what means this armed guard"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"That waits upon your grace?"
I,I,CLARENCE,"His majesty"
I,I,CLARENCE,"Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed"
I,I,CLARENCE,"This conduct to convey me to the Tower."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Upon what cause?"
I,I,CLARENCE,"Because my name is George."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"He should, for that, commit your godfathers:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"O, belike his majesty hath some intent"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?"
I,I,CLARENCE,"Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest"
I,I,CLARENCE,"As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,"
I,I,CLARENCE,"He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;"
I,I,CLARENCE,"And from the cross-row plucks the letter G."
I,I,CLARENCE,"And says a wizard told him that by G"
I,I,CLARENCE,"His issue disinherited should be;"
I,I,CLARENCE,"And, for my name of George begins with G,"
I,I,CLARENCE,"It follows in his thought that I am he."
I,I,CLARENCE,"These, as I learn, and such like toys as these"
I,I,CLARENCE,"Have moved his highness to commit me now."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"That tempers him to this extremity."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Was it not she and that good man of worship,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Anthony Woodville, her brother there,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"From whence this present day he is deliver'd?"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe."
I,I,CLARENCE,"By heaven, I think there's no man is secure"
I,I,CLARENCE,"But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds"
I,I,CLARENCE,"That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore."
I,I,CLARENCE,"Heard ye not what an humble suppliant"
I,I,CLARENCE,"Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Humbly complaining to her deity"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Got my lord chamberlain his liberty."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"If we will keep in favour with the king,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"To be her men and wear her livery:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Are mighty gossips in this monarchy."
I,I,BRAKENBURY,"I beseech your graces both to pardon me;"
I,I,BRAKENBURY,"His majesty hath straitly given in charge"
I,I,BRAKENBURY,"That no man shall have private conference,"
I,I,BRAKENBURY,"Of what degree soever, with his brother."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"You may partake of any thing we say:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"We speak no treason, man: we say the king"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"How say you sir? Can you deny all this?"
I,I,BRAKENBURY,"With this, my lord, myself have nought to do."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"He that doth naught with her, excepting one,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Were best he do it secretly, alone."
I,I,BRAKENBURY,"What one, my lord?"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?"
I,I,BRAKENBURY,"I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal"
I,I,BRAKENBURY,"Forbear your conference with the noble duke."
I,I,CLARENCE,"We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"We are the queen's abjects, and must obey."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And whatsoever you will employ me in,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"I will perform it to enfranchise you."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Touches me deeper than you can imagine."
I,I,CLARENCE,"I know it pleaseth neither of us well."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Meantime, have patience."
I,I,CLARENCE,"I must perforce. Farewell."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"If heaven will take the present at our hands."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?"
I,I,HASTINGS,"Good time of day unto my gracious lord!"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"As much unto my good lord chamberlain!"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Well are you welcome to the open air."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?"
I,I,HASTINGS,"With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:"
I,I,HASTINGS,"But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks"
I,I,HASTINGS,"That were the cause of my imprisonment."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"For they that were your enemies are his,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And have prevail'd as much on him as you."
I,I,HASTINGS,"More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,"
I,I,HASTINGS,"While kites and buzzards prey at liberty."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"What news abroad?"
I,I,HASTINGS,"No news so bad abroad as this at home;"
I,I,HASTINGS,"The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,"
I,I,HASTINGS,"And his physicians fear him mightily."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"O, he hath kept an evil diet long,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And overmuch consumed his royal person:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis very grievous to be thought upon."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"What, is he in his bed?"
I,I,HASTINGS,"He is."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Go you before, and I will follow you."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"He cannot live, I hope; and must not die"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And, if I fall not in my deep intent,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence hath not another day to live:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"And leave the world for me to bustle in!"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"What though I kill'd her husband and her father?"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"The readiest way to make the wench amends"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Is to become her husband and her father:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"The which will I; not all so much for love"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"As for another secret close intent,"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"By marrying her which I must reach unto."
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"But yet I run before my horse to market:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:"
I,I,GLOUCESTER,"When they are gone, then must I count my gains."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Set down, set down your honourable load,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"More direful hap betide that hated wretch,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"That makes us wretched by the death of thee,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"If ever he have child, abortive be it,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Whose ugly and unnatural aspect"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"May fright the hopeful mother at the view;"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"And that be heir to his unhappiness!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"If ever he have wife, let her he made"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"A miserable by the death of him"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"As I am made by my poor lord and thee!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Taken from Paul's to be interred there;"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"And still, as you are weary of the weight,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"What black magician conjures up this fiend,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"To stop devoted charitable deeds?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I'll make a corse of him that disobeys."
I,II,Gentleman,"My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Behold this pattern of thy butcheries."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Provokes this deluge most unnatural."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Either heaven with lightning strike the"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"murderer dead,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Lady, you know no rules of charity,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"But I know none, and therefore am no beast."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"More wonderful, when angels are so angry."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"By circumstance, but to acquit myself."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"For these known evils, but to give me leave,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Some patient leisure to excuse myself."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"No excuse current, but to hang thyself."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"By such despair, I should accuse myself."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Say that I slew them not?"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Why, then they are not dead:"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I did not kill your husband."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Why, then he is alive."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"The which thou once didst bend against her breast,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"But that thy brothers beat aside the point."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Didst thou not kill this king?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I grant ye."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"For he was fitter for that place than earth."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"And thou unfit for any place but hell."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Some dungeon."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Your bed-chamber."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"So will it, madam till I lie with you."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"I hope so."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"To leave this keen encounter of our wits,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And fall somewhat into a slower method,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Is not the causer of the timeless deaths"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"As blameful as the executioner?"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Your beauty was the cause of that effect;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"To undertake the death of all the world,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"You should not blemish it, if I stood by:"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"As all the world is cheered by the sun,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"So I by that; it is my day, my life."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"I would I were, to be revenged on thee."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"It is a quarrel most unnatural,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"To be revenged on him that loveth you."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"It is a quarrel just and reasonable,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"To be revenged on him that slew my husband."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Did it to help thee to a better husband."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"His better doth not breathe upon the earth."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"He lives that loves thee better than he could."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Name him."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Plantagenet."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Why, that was he."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"The selfsame name, but one of better nature."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Where is he?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Here."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Why dost thou spit at me?"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Never came poison from so sweet a place."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Never hung poison on a fouler toad."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I would they were, that I might die at once;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"For now they kill me with a living death."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"No, when my father York and Edward wept,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Told the sad story of my father's death,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I never sued to friend nor enemy;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"For kissing, lady, not for such contempt."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And humbly beg the death upon my knee."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Take up the sword again, or take up me."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"I will not be the executioner."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"I have already."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Tush, that was in thy rage:"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Speak it again, and, even with the word,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"I would I knew thy heart."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis figured in my tongue."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"I fear me both are false."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Then never man was true."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Well, well, put up your sword."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Say, then, my peace is made."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"That shall you know hereafter."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"But shall I live in hope?"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"All men, I hope, live so."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Vouchsafe to wear this ring."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"To take is not to give."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Look, how this ring encompasseth finger."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Wear both of them, for both of them are thine."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And if thy poor devoted suppliant may"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"What is it?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"That it would please thee leave these sad designs"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And presently repair to Crosby Place;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Where, after I have solemnly interr'd"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"At Chertsey monastery this noble king,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And wet his grave with my repentant tears,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I will with all expedient duty see you:"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Grant me this boon."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"With all my heart; and much it joys me too,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"To see you are become so penitent."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Bid me farewell."
I,II,LADY ANNE,"'Tis more than you deserve;"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"But since you teach me how to flatter you,"
I,II,LADY ANNE,"Imagine I have said farewell already."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Sirs, take up the corse."
I,II,GENTLEMEN,"Towards Chertsey, noble lord?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Was ever woman in this humour won?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I'll have her; but I will not keep her long."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"To take her in her heart's extremest hate,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"The bleeding witness of her hatred by;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Having God, her conscience, and these bars"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"against me,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And I nothing to back my suit at all,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"But the plain devil and dissembling looks,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Ha!"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Hath she forgot already that brave prince,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Framed in the prodigality of nature,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"The spacious world cannot again afford"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And will she yet debase her eyes on me,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And made her widow to a woful bed?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"My dukedom to a beggarly denier,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I do mistake my person all this while:"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Myself to be a marvellous proper man."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And entertain some score or two of tailors,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"To study fashions to adorn my body:"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Since I am crept in favour with myself,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Will maintain it with some little cost."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"And then return lamenting to my love."
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,"
I,II,GLOUCESTER,"That I may see my shadow as I pass."
I,III,RIVERS,"Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty"
I,III,RIVERS,"Will soon recover his accustom'd health."
I,III,GREY,"In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:"
I,III,GREY,"Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,"
I,III,GREY,"And cheer his grace with quick and merry words."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If he were dead, what would betide of me?"
I,III,RIVERS,"No other harm but loss of such a lord."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The loss of such a lord includes all harm."
I,III,GREY,"The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,"
I,III,GREY,"To be your comforter when he is gone."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Oh, he is young and his minority"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"A man that loves not me, nor none of you."
I,III,RIVERS,"Is it concluded that he shall be protector?"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"It is determined, not concluded yet:"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But so it must be, if the king miscarry."
I,III,GREY,"Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby."
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Good time of day unto your royal grace!"
I,III,DERBY,"God make your majesty joyful as you have been!"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To your good prayers will scarcely say amen."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I hate not you for her proud arrogance."
I,III,DERBY,"I do beseech you, either not believe"
I,III,DERBY,"The envious slanders of her false accusers;"
I,III,DERBY,"Or, if she be accused in true report,"
I,III,DERBY,"Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds"
I,III,DERBY,"From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice."
I,III,RIVERS,"Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?"
I,III,DERBY,"But now the Duke of Buckingham and I"
I,III,DERBY,"Are come from visiting his majesty."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What likelihood of his amendment, lords?"
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"God grant him health! Did you confer with him?"
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement"
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,"
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;"
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"And sent to warn them to his royal presence."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Would all were well! but that will never be"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I fear our happiness is at the highest."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Who are they that complain unto the king,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I must be held a rancorous enemy."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"But thus his simple truth must be abused"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?"
I,III,RIVERS,"To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"A plague upon you all! His royal person,--"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"But you must trouble him with lewd complaints."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The king, of his own royal disposition,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And not provoked by any suitor else;"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Which in your outward actions shows itself"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Since every Jack became a gentleman"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"There's many a gentle person made a Jack."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Come, come, we know your meaning, brother"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Gloucester;"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"You envy my advancement and my friends':"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"God grant we never may have need of you!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Your brother is imprison'd by your means,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Myself disgraced, and the nobility"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Are daily given to ennoble those"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"By Him that raised me to this careful height"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I never did incense his majesty"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"An earnest advocate to plead for him."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My lord, you do me shameful injury,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"You may deny that you were not the cause"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment."
I,III,RIVERS,"She may, my lord, for--"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"She may do more, sir, than denying that:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"She may help you to many fair preferments,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And then deny her aiding hand therein,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And lay those honours on your high deserts."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--"
I,III,RIVERS,"What, marry, may she?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"What, marry, may she! marry with a king,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I wis your grandam had a worser match."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"With those gross taunts I often have endured."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I had rather be a country servant-maid"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Than a great queen, with this condition,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Small joy have I in being England's queen."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy honour, state and seat is due to me."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"What! threat you me with telling of the king?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I will avouch in presence of the king:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Out, devil! I remember them too well:"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"A liberal rewarder of his friends:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"To royalize his blood I spilt mine own."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yea, and much better blood than his or thine."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"In all which time you and your husband Grey"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Were factious for the house of Lancaster;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Let me put in your minds, if you forget,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"What you have been ere now, and what you are;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Withal, what I have been, and what I am."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"A murderous villain, and so still thou art."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Which God revenge!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"To fight on Edward's party for the crown;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I am too childish-foolish for this world."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is."
I,III,RIVERS,"My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days"
I,III,RIVERS,"Which here you urge to prove us enemies,"
I,III,RIVERS,"We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:"
I,III,RIVERS,"So should we you, if you should be our king."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"As little joy, my lord, as you suppose"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"You should enjoy, were you this country's king,"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"As little joy may you suppose in me."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That I enjoy, being the queen thereof."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"For I am she, and altogether joyless."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"I can no longer hold me patient."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Which of you trembles not that looks on me?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O gentle villain, do not turn away!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"That will I make before I let thee go."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Wert thou not banished on pain of death?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"I was; but I do find more pain in banishment"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Than death can yield me here by my abode."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"A husband and a son thou owest to me;"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And all the pleasures you usurp are mine."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"The curse my noble father laid on thee,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"His curses, then from bitterness of soul"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So just is God, to right the innocent."
I,III,HASTINGS,"O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,"
I,III,HASTINGS,"And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!"
I,III,RIVERS,"Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported."
I,III,DORSET,"No man but prophesied revenge for it."
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Northumberland, then present, wept to see it."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"What were you snarling all before I came,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ready to catch each other by the throat,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And turn you all your hatred now on me?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Could all but answer for that peevish brat?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"If not by war, by surfeit die your king,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"As ours by murder, to make him a king!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Die in his youth by like untimely violence!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And see another, as I see thee now,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Long die thy happy days before thy death;"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"That none of you may live your natural age,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"But by some unlook'd accident cut off!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"If heaven have any grievous plague in store"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And then hurl down their indignation"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"The slave of nature and the son of hell!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou rag of honour! thou detested--"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Margaret."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Richard!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Ha!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"I call thee not."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, let me make the period to my curse!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'"
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"The time will come when thou shalt wish for me"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad."
I,III,HASTINGS,"False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,"
I,III,HASTINGS,"Lest to thy harm thou move our patience."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine."
I,III,RIVERS,"Were you well served, you would be taught your duty."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"To serve me well, you all should do me duty,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!"
I,III,DORSET,"Dispute not with her; she is lunatic."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, that your young nobility could judge"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess."
I,III,DORSET,"It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Witness my son, now in the shade of death;"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hath in eternal darkness folded up."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"As it was won with blood, lost be it so!"
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Have done! for shame, if not for charity."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Urge neither charity nor shame to me:"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Uncharitably with me have you dealt,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"My charity is outrage, life my shame"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage."
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Have done, have done."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"In sign of league and amity with thee:"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nor thou within the compass of my curse."
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Nor no one here; for curses never pass"
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"The lips of those that breathe them in the air."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"His venom tooth will rankle to the death:"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Have not to do with him, beware of him;"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And all their ministers attend on him."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?"
I,III,BUCKINGHAM,"Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord."
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, but remember this another day,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"Live each of you the subjects to his hate,"
I,III,QUEEN MARGARET,"And he to yours, and all of you to God's!"
I,III,HASTINGS,"My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses."
I,III,RIVERS,"And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"She hath had too much wrong; and I repent"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"My part thereof that I have done to her."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I never did her any, to my knowledge."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"But you have all the vantage of her wrong."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I was too hot to do somebody good,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"That is too cold in thinking of it now."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"God pardon them that are the cause of it!"
I,III,RIVERS,"A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,"
I,III,RIVERS,"To pray for them that have done scathe to us."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"So do I ever:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"being well-advised."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself."
I,III,CATESBY,"Madam, his majesty doth call for you,"
I,III,CATESBY,"And for your grace; and you, my noble lords."
I,III,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?"
I,III,RIVERS,"Madam, we will attend your grace."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"The secret mischiefs that I set abroach"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I lay unto the grievous charge of others."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I do beweep to many simple gulls"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And say it is the queen and her allies"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"That stir the king against the duke my brother."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Now, they believe it; and withal whet me"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And thus I clothe my naked villany"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"And seem a saint, when most I play the devil."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"But, soft! here come my executioners."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Are you now going to dispatch this deed?"
I,III,First Murderer,"We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant"
I,III,First Murderer,"That we may be admitted where he is."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Well thought upon; I have it here about me."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"When you have done, repair to Crosby Place."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"May move your hearts to pity if you mark him."
I,III,First Murderer,"Tush!"
I,III,First Murderer,"Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;"
I,III,First Murderer,"Talkers are no good doers: be assured"
I,III,First Murderer,"We come to use our hands and not our tongues."
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"I like you, lads; about your business straight;"
I,III,GLOUCESTER,"Go, go, dispatch."
I,III,First Murderer,"We will, my noble lord."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Why looks your grace so heavily today?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O, I have pass'd a miserable night,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"That, as I am a Christian faithful man,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"I would not spend another such a night,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"So full of dismal terror was the time!"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Who from my cabin tempted me to walk"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And cited up a thousand fearful times,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"During the wars of York and Lancaster"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"That had befall'n us. As we paced along"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Into the tumbling billows of the main."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Had you such leisure in the time of death"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Methought I had; and often did I strive"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"But smother'd it within my panting bulk,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Which almost burst to belch it in the sea."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Awaked you not with this sore agony?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O, then began the tempest to my soul,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"With that grim ferryman which poets write of,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Unto the kingdom of perpetual night."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"The first that there did greet my stranger soul,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"A shadow like an angel, with bright hair"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Such hideous cries, that with the very noise"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"I trembling waked, and for a season after"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Could not believe but that I was in hell,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Such terrible impression made the dream."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O Brakenbury, I have done those things,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Which now bear evidence against my soul,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Princes have but their tides for their glories,"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"An outward honour for an inward toil;"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"And, for unfelt imagination,"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"They often feel a world of restless cares:"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"So that, betwixt their tides and low names,"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"There's nothing differs but the outward fame."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Ho! who's here?"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?"
I,IV,First Murderer,"I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Yea, are you so brief?"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"him our commission; talk no more."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"I am, in this, commanded to deliver"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"I will not reason what is meant hereby,"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Because I will be guiltless of the meaning."
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"I'll to the king; and signify to him"
I,IV,BRAKENBURY,"That thus I have resign'd my charge to you."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?"
I,IV,First Murderer,"No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"the judgment-day."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"of remorse in me."
I,IV,First Murderer,"What, art thou afraid?"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us."
I,IV,First Murderer,"I thought thou hadst been resolute."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"So I am, to let him live."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"would tell twenty."
I,IV,First Murderer,"How dost thou feel thyself now?"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"within me."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Remember our reward, when the deed is done."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Where is thy conscience now?"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"In the Duke of Gloucester's purse."
I,IV,First Murderer,"So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"thy conscience flies out."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it."
I,IV,First Murderer,"How if it come to thee again?"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"is turned out of all towns and cities for a"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"dangerous thing; and every man that means to live"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"well endeavours to trust to himself and to live"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"without it."
I,IV,First Murderer,"'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me"
I,IV,First Murderer,"not to kill the duke."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"I warrant thee."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?"
I,IV,First Murderer,"Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy"
I,IV,First Murderer,"sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt"
I,IV,First Murderer,"in the next room."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"O excellent devise! make a sop of him."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"No, first let's reason with him."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine."
I,IV,Second murderer,"You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"In God's name, what art thou?"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"A man, as you are."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"But not, as I am, royal."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Nor you, as we are, loyal."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?"
I,IV,Both,"To, to, to--"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To murder me?"
I,IV,Both,"Ay, ay."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?"
I,IV,First Murderer,"Offended us you have not, but the king."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"I shall be reconciled to him again."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Are you call'd forth from out a world of men"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To slay the innocent? What is my offence?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Where are the evidence that do accuse me?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"What lawful quest have given their verdict up"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Before I be convict by course of law,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To threaten me with death is most unlawful."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"I charge you, as you hope to have redemption"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"That you depart and lay no hands on me"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"The deed you undertake is damnable."
I,IV,First Murderer,"What we will do, we do upon command."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"And he that hath commanded is the king."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Hath in the tables of his law commanded"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To hurl upon their heads that break his law."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"For false forswearing and for murder too:"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster."
I,IV,First Murderer,"And, like a traitor to the name of God,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade"
I,IV,First Murderer,"Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend."
I,IV,First Murderer,"How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"He sends ye not to murder me for this"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"For in this sin he is as deep as I."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"If God will be revenged for this deed."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"He needs no indirect nor lawless course"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To cut off those that have offended him."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"My brother's love, the devil, and my rage."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"I am his brother, and I love him well."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"If you be hired for meed, go back again,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Who shall reward you better for my life"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Than Edward will for tidings of my death."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Go you to him from me."
I,IV,Both,"Ay, so we will."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Tell him, when that our princely father York"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And charged us from his soul to love each other,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"He little thought of this divided friendship:"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O, do not slander him, for he is kind."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Right,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:"
I,IV,First Murderer,"'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"It cannot be; for when I parted with him,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"That he would labour my delivery."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To counsel me to make my peace with God,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"To do this deed will hate you for the deed."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"What shall we do?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Relent, and save your souls."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish."
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Which of you, if you were a prince's son,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Being pent from liberty, as I am now,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Would not entreat for life?"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"As you would beg, were you in my distress"
I,IV,CLARENCE,"A begging prince what beggar pities not?"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Look behind you, my lord."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Take that, and that: if all this will not do,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within."
I,IV,Second Murderer,"A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Of this most grievous guilty murder done!"
I,IV,First Murderer,"How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?"
I,IV,First Murderer,"By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"I would he knew that I had saved his brother!"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;"
I,IV,Second Murderer,"For I repent me that the duke is slain."
I,IV,First Murderer,"So do not I: go, coward as thou art."
I,IV,First Murderer,"Now must I hide his body in some hole,"
I,IV,First Murderer,"Until the duke take order for his burial:"
I,IV,First Murderer,"And when I have my meed, I must away;"
I,IV,First Murderer,"For this will out, and here I must not stay."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"You peers, continue this united league:"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"I every day expect an embassage"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Since I have set my friends at peace on earth."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love."
II,I,RIVERS,"By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:"
II,I,RIVERS,"And with my hand I seal my true heart's love."
II,I,HASTINGS,"So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Take heed you dally not before your king;"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Lest he that is the supreme King of kings"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Confound your hidden falsehood, and award"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Either of you to be the other's end."
II,I,HASTINGS,"So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!"
II,I,RIVERS,"And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"You have been factious one against the other,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And what you do, do it unfeignedly."
II,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Here, Hastings; I will never more remember"
II,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess."
II,I,DORSET,"This interchange of love, I here protest,"
II,I,DORSET,"Upon my part shall be unviolable."
II,I,HASTINGS,"And so swear I, my lord"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"With thy embracements to my wife's allies,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And make me happy in your unity."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"On you or yours,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"but with all duteous love"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"With hate in those where I expect most love!"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"When I have most need to employ a friend,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And most assured that he is a friend"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"When I am cold in zeal to yours."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"is this thy vow unto my sickly heart."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"To make the perfect period of this peace."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And, in good time, here comes the noble duke."
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"And, princely peers, a happy time of day!"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Brother, we done deeds of charity;"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers."
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Amongst this princely heap, if any here,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Hold me a foe;"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"If I unwittingly, or in my rage,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Have aught committed that is hardly borne"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"By any in this presence, I desire"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"To reconcile me to his friendly peace:"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis death to me to be at enmity;"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"I hate it, and desire all good men's love."
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Which I will purchase with my duteous service;"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"If ever any grudge were lodged between us;"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"That without desert have frown'd on me;"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all."
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"I do not know that Englishman alive"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"With whom my soul is any jot at odds"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"More than the infant that is born to-night"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"I thank my God for my humility."
II,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:"
II,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I would to God all strifes were well compounded."
II,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty"
II,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To take our brother Clarence to your grace."
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"To be so bouted in this royal presence?"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"You do him injury to scorn his corse."
II,I,RIVERS,"Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?"
II,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"All seeing heaven, what a world is this!"
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?"
II,I,DORSET,"Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence"
II,I,DORSET,"But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed."
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"But he, poor soul, by your first order died,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"And that a winged Mercury did bear:"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"That came too lag to see him buried."
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"And yet go current from suspicion!"
II,I,DORSET,"A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow."
II,I,DORSET,"I will not rise, unless your highness grant."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st."
II,I,DORSET,"The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;"
II,I,DORSET,"Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman"
II,I,DORSET,"Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And shall the same give pardon to a slave?"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And yet his punishment was cruel death."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Who told me how the poor soul did forsake"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Who told me, when we both lay in the field"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Even in his own garments, and gave himself,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"All this from my remembrance brutish wrath"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Had so much grace to put it in my mind."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"But when your carters or your waiting-vassals"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"The precious image of our dear Redeemer,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"And I unjustly too, must grant it you"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"But for my brother not a man would speak,"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Have been beholding to him in his life;"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet none of you would once plead for his life."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"O God, I fear thy justice will take hold"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!"
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Come, Hastings, help me to my closet."
II,I,KING EDWARD IV,"Oh, poor Clarence!"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"How that the guilty kindred of the queen"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"O, they did urge it still unto the king!"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"God will revenge it. But come, let us in,"
II,I,GLOUCESTER,"To comfort Edward with our company."
II,I,BUCKINGHAM,"We wait upon your grace."
II,II,Boy,"Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"No, boy."
II,II,Boy,"Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,"
II,II,Boy,"And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'"
II,II,Girl,"Why do you look on us, and shake your head,"
II,II,Girl,"And call us wretches, orphans, castaways"
II,II,Girl,"If that our noble father be alive?"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I do lament the sickness of the king."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"As loath to lose him, not your father's death;"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost."
II,II,Boy,"Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead."
II,II,Boy,"The king my uncle is to blame for this:"
II,II,Boy,"God will revenge it; whom I will importune"
II,II,Boy,"With daily prayers all to that effect."
II,II,Girl,"And so will I."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Incapable and shallow innocents,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"You cannot guess who caused your father's death."
II,II,Boy,"Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester"
II,II,Boy,"Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,"
II,II,Boy,"Devised impeachments to imprison him :"
II,II,Boy,"And when my uncle told me so, he wept,"
II,II,Boy,"And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;"
II,II,Boy,"Bade me rely on him as on my father,"
II,II,Boy,"And he would love me dearly as his child."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit."
II,II,Boy,"Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ay, boy."
II,II,Boy,"I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To chide my fortune, and torment myself?"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I'll join with black despair against my soul,"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And to myself become an enemy."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"What means this scene of rude impatience?"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To make an act of tragic violence:"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead."
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Or, like obedient subjects, follow him"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To his new kingdom of perpetual rest."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"As I had title in thy noble husband!"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I have bewept a worthy husband's death,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And lived by looking on his images:"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"But now two mirrors of his princely semblance"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And I for comfort have but one false glass,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Which grieves me when I see my shame in him."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thine being but a moiety of my grief,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!"
II,II,Boy,"Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;"
II,II,Boy,"How can we aid you with our kindred tears?"
II,II,Girl,"Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;"
II,II,Girl,"Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Give me no help in lamentation;"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I am not barren to bring forth complaints"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!"
II,II,Children,"Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone."
II,II,Children,"What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"What stays had I but they? and they are gone."
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Was never widow had so dear a loss!"
II,II,Children,"Were never orphans had so dear a loss!"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Was never mother had so dear a loss!"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alas, I am the mother of these moans!"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I for an Edward weep, so do not they:"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And I will pamper it with lamentations."
II,II,DORSET,"Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased"
II,II,DORSET,"That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:"
II,II,DORSET,"In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,"
II,II,DORSET,"With dull unwilligness to repay a debt"
II,II,DORSET,"Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;"
II,II,DORSET,"Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,"
II,II,DORSET,"For it requires the royal debt it lent you."
II,II,RIVERS,"Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,"
II,II,RIVERS,"Of the young prince your son: send straight for him"
II,II,RIVERS,"Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:"
II,II,RIVERS,"Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,"
II,II,RIVERS,"And plant your joys in living Edward's throne."
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"To wail the dimming of our shining star;"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"But none can cure their harms by wailing them."
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"I crave your blessing."
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,"
II,II,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"I marvel why her grace did leave it out."
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Now cheer each other in each other's love"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Though we have spent our harvest of this king,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"We are to reap the harvest of his son."
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Hither to London, to be crown'd our king."
II,II,RIVERS,"Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Which would be so much the more dangerous"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Where every horse bears his commanding rein,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"And may direct his course as please himself,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"In my opinion, ought to be prevented."
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"I hope the king made peace with all of us"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"And the compact is firm and true in me."
II,II,RIVERS,"And so in me; and so, I think, in all:"
II,II,RIVERS,"Yet, since it is but green, it should be put"
II,II,RIVERS,"To no apparent likelihood of breach,"
II,II,RIVERS,"Which haply by much company might be urged:"
II,II,RIVERS,"Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,"
II,II,RIVERS,"That it is meet so few should fetch the prince."
II,II,HASTINGS,"And so say I."
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"Then be it so; and go we to determine"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow."
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, and you, my mother, will you go"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"To give your censures in this weighty business?"
II,II,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"With all our harts."
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"For God's sake, let not us two be behind;"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"As index to the story we late talk'd of,"
II,II,BUCKINGHAM,"To part the queen's proud kindred from the king."
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"My other self, my counsel's consistory,"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,"
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"I, like a child, will go by thy direction."
II,II,GLOUCESTER,"Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind."
II,III,First Citizen,"Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?"
II,III,Second Citizen,"I promise you, I scarcely know myself:"
II,III,Second Citizen,"Hear you the news abroad?"
II,III,First Citizen,"Ay, that the king is dead."
II,III,Second Citizen,"Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:"
II,III,Second Citizen,"I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world."
II,III,Third Citizen,"Neighbours, God speed!"
II,III,First Citizen,"Give you good morrow, sir."
II,III,Third Citizen,"Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?"
II,III,Second Citizen,"Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!"
II,III,Third Citizen,"Then, masters, look to see a troublous world."
II,III,First Citizen,"No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign."
II,III,Third Citizen,"Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!"
II,III,Second Citizen,"In him there is a hope of government,"
II,III,Second Citizen,"That in his nonage council under him,"
II,III,Second Citizen,"And in his full and ripen'd years himself,"
II,III,Second Citizen,"No doubt, shall then and till then govern well."
II,III,First Citizen,"So stood the state when Henry the Sixth"
II,III,First Citizen,"Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old."
II,III,Third Citizen,"Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;"
II,III,Third Citizen,"For then this land was famously enrich'd"
II,III,Third Citizen,"With politic grave counsel; then the king"
II,III,Third Citizen,"Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace."
II,III,First Citizen,"Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother."
II,III,Third Citizen,"Better it were they all came by the father,"
II,III,Third Citizen,"Or by the father there were none at all;"
II,III,Third Citizen,"For emulation now, who shall be nearest,"
II,III,Third Citizen,"Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not."
II,III,Third Citizen,"O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!"
II,III,Third Citizen,"And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:"
II,III,Third Citizen,"And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,"
II,III,Third Citizen,"This sickly land might solace as before."
II,III,First Citizen,"Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well."
II,III,Third Citizen,"When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;"
II,III,Third Citizen,"When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;"
II,III,Third Citizen,"When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?"
II,III,Third Citizen,"Untimely storms make men expect a dearth."
II,III,Third Citizen,"All may be well; but, if God sort it so,"
II,III,Third Citizen,"'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect."
II,III,Second Citizen,"Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:"
II,III,Second Citizen,"Ye cannot reason almost with a man"
II,III,Second Citizen,"That looks not heavily and full of fear."
II,III,Third Citizen,"Before the times of change, still is it so:"
II,III,Third Citizen,"By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust"
II,III,Third Citizen,"Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see"
II,III,Third Citizen,"The waters swell before a boisterous storm."
II,III,Third Citizen,"But leave it all to God. whither away?"
II,III,Second Citizen,"Marry, we were sent for to the justices."
II,III,Third Citizen,"And so was I: I'll bear you company."
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;"
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:"
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To-morrow, or next day, they will be here."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I long with all my heart to see the prince:"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I hope he is much grown since last I saw him."
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But I hear, no; they say my son of York"
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Hath almost overta'en him in his growth."
II,IV,YORK,"Ay, mother; but I would not have it so."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow."
II,IV,YORK,"Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,"
II,IV,YORK,"My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow"
II,IV,YORK,"More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle"
II,IV,YORK,"Gloucester,"
II,IV,YORK,"'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'"
II,IV,YORK,"And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,"
II,IV,YORK,"Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"In him that did object the same to thee;"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"So long a-growing and so leisurely,"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious."
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt."
II,IV,YORK,"Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,"
II,IV,YORK,"I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,"
II,IV,YORK,"To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it."
II,IV,YORK,"Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast"
II,IV,YORK,"That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old"
II,IV,YORK,"'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth."
II,IV,YORK,"Grandam, this would have been a biting jest."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?"
II,IV,YORK,"Grandam, his nurse."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born."
II,IV,YORK,"If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me."
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd."
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Good madam, be not angry with the child."
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Pitchers have ears."
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Here comes a messenger. What news?"
II,IV,Messenger,"Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold."
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"How fares the prince?"
II,IV,Messenger,"Well, madam, and in health."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"What is thy news then?"
II,IV,Messenger,"Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,"
II,IV,Messenger,"With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Who hath committed them?"
II,IV,Messenger,"The mighty dukes"
II,IV,Messenger,"Gloucester and Buckingham."
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For what offence?"
II,IV,Messenger,"The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;"
II,IV,Messenger,"Why or for what these nobles were committed"
II,IV,Messenger,"Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady."
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!"
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;"
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Insulting tyranny begins to jet"
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Upon the innocent and aweless throne:"
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!"
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I see, as in a map, the end of all."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"How many of you have mine eyes beheld!"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"My husband lost his life to get the crown;"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And often up and down my sons were toss'd,"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And being seated, and domestic broils"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Self against self: O, preposterous"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;"
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Or let me die, to look on death no more!"
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary."
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Madam, farewell."
II,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I'll go along with you."
II,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"You have no cause."
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"My gracious lady, go;"
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And thither bear your treasure and your goods."
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For my part, I'll resign unto your grace"
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The seal I keep: and so betide to me"
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"As well I tender you and all of yours!"
II,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"The weary way hath made you melancholy."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"No, uncle; but our crosses on the way"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"I want more uncles here to welcome me."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Nor more can you distinguish of a man"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Those uncles which you want were dangerous;"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"God keep you from them, and from such false friends!"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"God keep me from false friends! but they were none."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you."
III,I,Lord Mayor,"God bless your grace with health and happy days!"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"I thought my mother, and my brother York,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Would long ere this have met us on the way"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"To tell us whether they will come or no!"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?"
III,I,HASTINGS,"On what occasion, God he knows, not I,"
III,I,HASTINGS,"The queen your mother, and your brother York,"
III,I,HASTINGS,"Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince"
III,I,HASTINGS,"Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,"
III,I,HASTINGS,"But by his mother was perforce withheld."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Fie, what an indirect and peevish course"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Unto his princely brother presently?"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce."
III,I,CARDINAL,"My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory"
III,I,CARDINAL,"Can from his mother win the Duke of York,"
III,I,CARDINAL,"Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate"
III,I,CARDINAL,"To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid"
III,I,CARDINAL,"We should infringe the holy privilege"
III,I,CARDINAL,"Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land"
III,I,CARDINAL,"Would I be guilty of so deep a sin."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Too ceremonious and traditional"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"You break not sanctuary in seizing him."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"The benefit thereof is always granted"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To those whose dealings have deserved the place,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And those who have the wit to claim the place:"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Then, taking him from thence that is not there,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"You break no privilege nor charter there."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"But sanctuary children ne'er till now."
III,I,CARDINAL,"My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once."
III,I,CARDINAL,"Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?"
III,I,HASTINGS,"I go, my lord."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Where it seems best unto your royal self."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"If I may counsel you, some day or two"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"For your best health and recreation."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"I do not like the Tower, of any place."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Is it upon record, or else reported"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Successively from age to age, he built it?"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Upon record, my gracious lord."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"But say, my lord, it were not register'd,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Methinks the truth should live from age to age,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Even to the general all-ending day."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"live long."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"What say you, uncle?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"I say, without characters, fame lives long."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"I moralize two meanings in one word."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"That Julius Caesar was a famous man;"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"With what his valour did enrich his wit,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"His wit set down to make his valour live"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"For now he lives in fame, though not in life."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"What, my gracious lord?"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"An if I live until I be a man,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"I'll win our ancient right in France again,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Or die a soldier, as I lived a king."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?"
III,I,YORK,"Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Too late he died that might have kept that title,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Which by his death hath lost much majesty."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?"
III,I,YORK,"I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,"
III,I,YORK,"You said that idle weeds are fast in growth"
III,I,YORK,"The prince my brother hath outgrown me far."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"He hath, my lord."
III,I,YORK,"And therefore is he idle?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"O, my fair cousin, I must not say so."
III,I,YORK,"Then is he more beholding to you than I."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"He may command me as my sovereign;"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"But you have power in me as in a kinsman."
III,I,YORK,"I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"A beggar, brother?"
III,I,YORK,"Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;"
III,I,YORK,"And being but a toy, which is no grief to give."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin."
III,I,YORK,"A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"A gentle cousin, were it light enough."
III,I,YORK,"O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;"
III,I,YORK,"In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"It is too heavy for your grace to wear."
III,I,YORK,"I weigh it lightly, were it heavier."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"What, would you have my weapon, little lord?"
III,I,YORK,"I would, that I might thank you as you call me."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"How?"
III,I,YORK,"Little."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him."
III,I,YORK,"You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:"
III,I,YORK,"Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;"
III,I,YORK,"Because that I am little, like an ape,"
III,I,YORK,"He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"He prettily and aptly taunts himself:"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"So cunning and so young is wonderful."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"My lord, will't please you pass along?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Myself and my good cousin Buckingham"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Will to your mother, to entreat of her"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"To meet you at the Tower and welcome you."
III,I,YORK,"What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"My lord protector needs will have it so."
III,I,YORK,"I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Why, what should you fear?"
III,I,YORK,"Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:"
III,I,YORK,"My grandam told me he was murdered there."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"I fear no uncles dead."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Nor none that live, I hope."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"An if they live, I hope I need not fear."
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,"
III,I,PRINCE EDWARD,"Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Think you, my lord, this little prating York"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Was not incensed by his subtle mother"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"He is all the mother's, from the top to toe."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"As closely to conceal what we impart:"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"For the instalment of this noble duke"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"In the seat royal of this famous isle?"
III,I,CATESBY,"He for his father's sake so loves the prince,"
III,I,CATESBY,"That he will not be won to aught against him."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?"
III,I,CATESBY,"He will do all in all as Hastings doth."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"How doth he stand affected to our purpose;"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To sit about the coronation."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"If thou dost find him tractable to us,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And give us notice of his inclination:"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"For we to-morrow hold divided councils,"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly."
III,I,CATESBY,"My good lords both, with all the heed I may."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?"
III,I,CATESBY,"You shall, my lord."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive"
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd."
III,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"And look to have it yielded with all willingness."
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards"
III,I,GLOUCESTER,"We may digest our complots in some form."
III,II,Messenger,"What, ho! my lord!"
III,II,Messenger,"A messenger from the Lord Stanley."
III,II,HASTINGS,"What is't o'clock?"
III,II,Messenger,"Upon the stroke of four."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?"
III,II,Messenger,"So it should seem by that I have to say."
III,II,Messenger,"First, he commends him to your noble lordship."
III,II,HASTINGS,"And then?"
III,II,Messenger,"And then he sends you word"
III,II,Messenger,"He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:"
III,II,Messenger,"Besides, he says there are two councils held;"
III,II,Messenger,"And that may be determined at the one"
III,II,Messenger,"which may make you and him to rue at the other."
III,II,Messenger,"Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,"
III,II,Messenger,"If presently you will take horse with him,"
III,II,Messenger,"And with all speed post with him toward the north,"
III,II,Messenger,"To shun the danger that his soul divines."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Bid him not fear the separated councils"
III,II,HASTINGS,"His honour and myself are at the one,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"And at the other is my servant Catesby"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Whereof I shall not have intelligence."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:"
III,II,HASTINGS,"And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond"
III,II,HASTINGS,"To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers"
III,II,HASTINGS,"To fly the boar before the boar pursues,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Were to incense the boar to follow us"
III,II,HASTINGS,"And make pursuit where he did mean no chase."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Go, bid thy master rise and come to me"
III,II,HASTINGS,"And we will both together to the Tower,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly."
III,II,Messenger,"My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say."
III,II,CATESBY,"Many good morrows to my noble lord!"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring"
III,II,HASTINGS,"What news, what news, in this our tottering state?"
III,II,CATESBY,"It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;"
III,II,CATESBY,"And I believe twill never stand upright"
III,II,CATESBY,"Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm."
III,II,HASTINGS,"How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?"
III,II,CATESBY,"Ay, my good lord."
III,II,HASTINGS,"I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced."
III,II,HASTINGS,"But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?"
III,II,CATESBY,"Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward"
III,II,CATESBY,"Upon his party for the gain thereof:"
III,II,CATESBY,"And thereupon he sends you this good news,"
III,II,CATESBY,"That this same very day your enemies,"
III,II,CATESBY,"The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Because they have been still mine enemies:"
III,II,HASTINGS,"But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"To bar my master's heirs in true descent,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"God knows I will not do it, to the death."
III,II,CATESBY,"God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!"
III,II,HASTINGS,"But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"That they who brought me in my master's hate"
III,II,HASTINGS,"I live to look upon their tragedy."
III,II,HASTINGS,"I tell thee, Catesby--"
III,II,CATESBY,"What, my lord?"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Ere a fortnight make me elder,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"I'll send some packing that yet think not on it."
III,II,CATESBY,"'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,"
III,II,CATESBY,"When men are unprepared and look not for it."
III,II,HASTINGS,"O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out"
III,II,HASTINGS,"With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do"
III,II,HASTINGS,"With some men else, who think themselves as safe"
III,II,HASTINGS,"As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear"
III,II,HASTINGS,"To princely Richard and to Buckingham."
III,II,CATESBY,"The princes both make high account of you;"
III,II,CATESBY,"For they account his head upon the bridge."
III,II,HASTINGS,"I know they do; and I have well deserved it."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?"
III,II,STANLEY,"My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:"
III,II,STANLEY,"You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,"
III,II,STANLEY,"I do not like these several councils, I."
III,II,HASTINGS,"My lord,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"I hold my life as dear as you do yours;"
III,II,HASTINGS,"And never in my life, I do protest,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Think you, but that I know our state secure,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"I would be so triumphant as I am?"
III,II,STANLEY,"The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,"
III,II,STANLEY,"Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,"
III,II,STANLEY,"And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;"
III,II,STANLEY,"But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast."
III,II,STANLEY,"This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:"
III,II,STANLEY,"Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!"
III,II,STANLEY,"What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?"
III,II,HASTINGS,"To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded."
III,II,LORD STANLEY,"They, for their truth, might better wear their heads"
III,II,LORD STANLEY,"Than some that have accused them wear their hats."
III,II,LORD STANLEY,"But come, my lord, let us away."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow."
III,II,HASTINGS,"How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?"
III,II,Pursuivant,"The better that your lordship please to ask."
III,II,HASTINGS,"I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Than when I met thee last where now we meet:"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"By the suggestion of the queen's allies;"
III,II,HASTINGS,"But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--"
III,II,HASTINGS,"This day those enemies are put to death,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"And I in better state than e'er I was."
III,II,Pursuivant,"God hold it, to your honour's good content!"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me."
III,II,Pursuivant,"God save your lordship!"
III,II,Priest,"Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour."
III,II,HASTINGS,"I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart."
III,II,HASTINGS,"I am in your debt for your last exercise;"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you."
III,II,BUCKINGHAM,"What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?"
III,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;"
III,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Your honour hath no shriving work in hand."
III,II,HASTINGS,"Good faith, and when I met this holy man,"
III,II,HASTINGS,"Those men you talk of came into my mind."
III,II,HASTINGS,"What, go you toward the Tower?"
III,II,BUCKINGHAM,"I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay"
III,II,BUCKINGHAM,"I shall return before your lordship thence."
III,II,HASTINGS,"'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there."
III,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Come, will you go?"
III,II,HASTINGS,"I'll wait upon your lordship."
III,III,RATCLIFF,"Come, bring forth the prisoners."
III,III,RIVERS,"Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:"
III,III,RIVERS,"To-day shalt thou behold a subject die"
III,III,RIVERS,"For truth, for duty, and for loyalty."
III,III,GREY,"God keep the prince from all the pack of you!"
III,III,GREY,"A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!"
III,III,VAUGHAN,"You live that shall cry woe for this after."
III,III,RATCLIFF,"Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out."
III,III,RIVERS,"O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,"
III,III,RIVERS,"Fatal and ominous to noble peers!"
III,III,RIVERS,"Within the guilty closure of thy walls"
III,III,RIVERS,"Richard the second here was hack'd to death;"
III,III,RIVERS,"And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,"
III,III,RIVERS,"We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink."
III,III,GREY,"Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,"
III,III,GREY,"For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son."
III,III,RIVERS,"Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,"
III,III,RIVERS,"Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God"
III,III,RIVERS,"To hear her prayers for them, as now for us"
III,III,RIVERS,"And for my sister and her princely sons,"
III,III,RIVERS,"Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,"
III,III,RIVERS,"Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt."
III,III,RATCLIFF,"Make haste; the hour of death is expiate."
III,III,RIVERS,"Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:"
III,III,RIVERS,"And take our leave, until we meet in heaven."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"My lords, at once: the cause why we are met"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Is, to determine of the coronation."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?"
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Are all things fitting for that royal time?"
III,IV,DERBY,"It is, and wants but nomination."
III,IV,BISHOP OF ELY,"To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day."
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?"
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Who is most inward with the royal duke?"
III,IV,BISHOP OF ELY,"Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind."
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,"
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,"
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Than I of yours;"
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Nor I no more of his, than you of mine."
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"But, for his purpose in the coronation."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"His gracious pleasure any way therein:"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"But you, my noble lords, may name the time;"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part."
III,IV,BISHOP OF ELY,"Now in good time, here comes the duke himself."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"My absence doth neglect no great designs,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Which by my presence might have been concluded."
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Had not you come upon your cue, my lord"
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--"
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"His lordship knows me well, and loves me well."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"I thank your grace."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"My lord of Ely!"
III,IV,BISHOP OF ELY,"My lord?"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"When I was last in Holborn,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"I saw good strawberries in your garden there"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"I do beseech you send for some of them."
III,IV,BISHOP OF ELY,"Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"And finds the testy gentleman so hot,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"As he will lose his head ere give consent"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Shall lose the royalty of England's throne."
III,IV,BUCKINGHAM,"Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you."
III,IV,DERBY,"We have not yet set down this day of triumph."
III,IV,DERBY,"To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;"
III,IV,DERBY,"For I myself am not so well provided"
III,IV,DERBY,"As else I would be, were the day prolong'd."
III,IV,BISHOP OF ELY,"Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these"
III,IV,BISHOP OF ELY,"strawberries."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"There's some conceit or other likes him well,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"I think there's never a man in Christendom"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"That can less hide his love or hate than he;"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"For by his face straight shall you know his heart."
III,IV,DERBY,"What of his heart perceive you in his face"
III,IV,DERBY,"By any likelihood he show'd to-day?"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Marry, that with no man here he is offended;"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"For, were he, he had shown it in his looks."
III,IV,DERBY,"I pray God he be not, I say."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"I pray you all, tell me what they deserve"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"That do conspire my death with devilish plots"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Upon my body with their hellish charms?"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Makes me most forward in this noble presence"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"I say, my lord, they have deserved death."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"That by their witchcraft thus have marked me."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"I will not dine until I see the same."
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:"
III,IV,GLOUCESTER,"The rest, that love me, rise and follow me."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"For I, too fond, might have prevented this."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"O, now I want the priest that spake to me:"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"I now repent I told the pursuivant"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"And I myself secure in grace and favour."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!"
III,IV,RATCLIFF,"Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:"
III,IV,RATCLIFF,"Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"O momentary grace of mortal men,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Ready, with every nod, to tumble down"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Into the fatal bowels of the deep."
III,IV,LOVEL,"Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"O bloody Richard! miserable England!"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee"
III,IV,HASTINGS,"That ever wretched age hath look'd upon."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head."
III,IV,HASTINGS,"They smile at me that shortly shall be dead."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"And then begin again, and stop again,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Speak and look back, and pry on every side,"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Are at my service, like enforced smiles;"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"And both are ready in their offices,"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"At any time, to grace my stratagems."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"But what, is Catesby gone?"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Lord mayor,--"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Look to the drawbridge there!"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Hark! a drum."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Catesby, o'erlook the walls."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Look back, defend thee, here are enemies."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"God and our innocency defend and guard us!"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel."
III,V,LOVEL,"Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,"
III,V,LOVEL,"The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"So dear I loved the man, that I must weep."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"I took him for the plainest harmless creature"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"That breathed upon this earth a Christian;"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Made him my book wherein my soul recorded"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"The history of all her secret thoughts:"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"That, his apparent open guilt omitted,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"He lived from all attainder of suspect."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"That ever lived."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Would you imagine, or almost believe,"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Were't not that, by great preservation,"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"This day had plotted, in the council-house"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"What, had he so?"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"What, think You we are Turks or infidels?"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Or that we would, against the form of law,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"But that the extreme peril of the case,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"The peace of England and our persons' safety,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Enforced us to this execution?"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"To warn false traitors from the like attempts."
III,V,Lord Mayor,"I never look'd for better at his hands,"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"After he once fell in with Mistress Shore."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Yet had not we determined he should die,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Until your lordship came to see his death;"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Which now the loving haste of these our friends,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Because, my lord, we would have had you heard"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"The traitor speak, and timorously confess"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"The manner and the purpose of his treason;"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"That you might well have signified the same"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Unto the citizens, who haply may"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Misconstrue us in him and wail his death."
III,V,Lord Mayor,"But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"As well as I had seen and heard him speak"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"And doubt you not, right noble princes both,"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens"
III,V,Lord Mayor,"With all your just proceedings in this cause."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"To avoid the carping censures of the world."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"But since you come too late of our intents,"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet witness what you hear we did intend:"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Only for saying he would make his son"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Which, by the sign thereof was termed so."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Moreover, urge his hateful luxury"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"And bestial appetite in change of lust;"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Without control, listed to make his prey."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Tell them, when that my mother went with child"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"My princely father then had wars in France"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"And, by just computation of the time,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Found that the issue was not his begot;"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Which well appeared in his lineaments,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Being nothing like the noble duke my father:"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Because you know, my lord, my mother lives."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"As if the golden fee for which I plead"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Where you shall find me well accompanied"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops."
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"I go: and towards three or four o'clock"
III,V,BUCKINGHAM,"Look for the news that the Guildhall affords."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle."
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"Now will I in, to take some privy order,"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"And to give notice, that no manner of person"
III,V,GLOUCESTER,"At any time have recourse unto the princes."
III,VI,Scrivener,"This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;"
III,VI,Scrivener,"Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,"
III,VI,Scrivener,"That it may be this day read over in Paul's."
III,VI,Scrivener,"And mark how well the sequel hangs together:"
III,VI,Scrivener,"Eleven hours I spent to write it over,"
III,VI,Scrivener,"For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;"
III,VI,Scrivener,"The precedent was full as long a-doing:"
III,VI,Scrivener,"And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,"
III,VI,Scrivener,"Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty"
III,VI,Scrivener,"Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,"
III,VI,Scrivener,"That seeth not this palpable device?"
III,VI,Scrivener,"Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?"
III,VI,Scrivener,"Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,"
III,VI,Scrivener,"When such bad dealings must be seen in thought."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"How now, my lord, what say the citizens?"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"The citizens are mum and speak not a word."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And his contract by deputy in France;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"The insatiate greediness of his desires,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And his enforcement of the city wives;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"As being got, your father then in France,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"His resemblance, being not like the duke;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Withal I did infer your lineaments,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Being the right idea of your father,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Both in your form and nobleness of mind;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Laid open all your victories in Scotland,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And when mine oratory grew to an end"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"I bid them that did love their country's good"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Ah! and did they so?"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"No, so God help me, they spake not a word;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Which when I saw, I reprehended them;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"His answer was, the people were not wont"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"To be spoke to but by the recorder."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Then he was urged to tell my tale again,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But nothing spake in warrant from himself."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"When he had done, some followers of mine own,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And thus I took the vantage of those few,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"'This general applause and loving shout"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And even here brake off, and came away."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"No, by my troth, my lord."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And be not easily won to our request:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"I go; and if you plead as well for them"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"As I can say nay to thee for myself,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"No doubt well bring it to a happy issue."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"I think the duke will not be spoke withal."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"What says he?"
III,VII,CATESBY,"My lord: he doth entreat your grace;"
III,VII,CATESBY,"To visit him to-morrow or next day:"
III,VII,CATESBY,"He is within, with two right reverend fathers,"
III,VII,CATESBY,"Divinely bent to meditation;"
III,VII,CATESBY,"And no worldly suit would he be moved,"
III,VII,CATESBY,"To draw him from his holy exercise."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"In deep designs and matters of great moment,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"No less importing than our general good,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Are come to have some conference with his grace."
III,VII,CATESBY,"I'll tell him what you say, my lord."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But on his knees at meditation;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But meditating with two deep divines;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Happy were England, would this gracious prince"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it."
III,VII,Lord Mayor,"Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"I fear he will."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"How now, Catesby, what says your lord?"
III,VII,CATESBY,"My lord,"
III,VII,CATESBY,"He wonders to what end you have assembled"
III,VII,CATESBY,"Such troops of citizens to speak with him,"
III,VII,CATESBY,"His grace not being warn'd thereof before:"
III,VII,CATESBY,"My lord, he fears you mean no good to him."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Sorry I am my noble cousin should"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And so once more return and tell his grace."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"When holy and devout religious men"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"So sweet is zealous contemplation."
III,VII,Lord Mayor,"See, where he stands between two clergymen!"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"To stay him from the fall of vanity:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"True ornaments to know a holy man."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Lend favourable ears to our request;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And pardon us the interruption"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"My lord, there needs no such apology:"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"I rather do beseech you pardon me,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Who, earnest in the service of my God,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Neglect the visitation of my friends."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And all good men of this ungovern'd isle."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"I do suspect I have done some offence"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"And that you come to reprehend my ignorance."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"At our entreaties, to amend that fault!"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Then know, it is your fault that you resign"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"The supreme seat, the throne majestical,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"The scepter'd office of your ancestors,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Your state of fortune and your due of birth,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"The lineal glory of your royal house,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"To the corruption of a blemished stock:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Which here we waken to our country's good,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Her face defaced with scars of infamy,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Which to recure, we heartily solicit"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Your gracious self to take on you the charge"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And kingly government of this your land,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Not as protector, steward, substitute,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Or lowly factor for another's gain;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But as successively from blood to blood,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Your right of birth, your empery, your own."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"For this, consorted with the citizens,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Your very worshipful and loving friends,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And by their vehement instigation,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"In this just suit come I to move your grace."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"I know not whether to depart in silence,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Or bitterly to speak in your reproof."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Best fitteth my degree or your condition"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"If not to answer, you might haply think"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Which fondly you would here impose on me;"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"If to reprove you for this suit of yours,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"So season'd with your faithful love to me."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Definitively thus I answer you."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Unmeritable shuns your high request."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"First if all obstacles were cut away,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"And that my path were even to the crown,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"As my ripe revenue and due by birth"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"So mighty and so many my defects,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"As I had rather hide me from my greatness,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Than in my greatness covet to be hid,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"And in the vapour of my glory smother'd."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"And much I need to help you, if need were;"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Will well become the seat of majesty,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"On him I lay what you would lay on me,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"The right and fortune of his happy stars;"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Which God defend that I should wring from him!"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"All circumstances well considered."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"You say that Edward is your brother's son:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Your mother lives a witness to that vow--"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And afterward by substitute betroth'd"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"To Bona, sister to the King of France."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"These both put by a poor petitioner,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"A care-crazed mother of a many children,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"A beauty-waning and distressed widow,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Even in the afternoon of her best days,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"To base declension and loathed bigamy"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"By her, in his unlawful bed, he got"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"This Edward, whom our manners term the prince."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"More bitterly could I expostulate,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Save that, for reverence to some alive,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"I give a sparing limit to my tongue."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Then, good my lord, take to your royal self"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"This proffer'd benefit of dignity;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"If non to bless us and the land withal,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"From the corruption of abusing times,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Unto a lineal true-derived course."
III,VII,Lord Mayor,"Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love."
III,VII,CATESBY,"O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"I am unfit for state and majesty;"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"I do beseech you, take it not amiss;"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"I cannot nor I will not yield to you."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"As well we know your tenderness of heart"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Which we have noted in you to your kin,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And egally indeed to all estates,--"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet whether you accept our suit or no,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Your brother's son shall never reign our king;"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"But we will plant some other in the throne,"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"To the disgrace and downfall of your house:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And in this resolution here we leave you.--"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham."
III,VII,CATESBY,"Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit."
III,VII,ANOTHER,"Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Would you enforce me to a world of care?"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"But penetrable to your. kind entreats,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Albeit against my conscience and my soul."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Since you will buckle fortune on my back,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"I must have patience to endure the load:"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Attend the sequel of your imposition,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"From all the impure blots and stains thereof;"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"For God he knows, and you may partly see,"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"How far I am from the desire thereof."
III,VII,Lord Mayor,"God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"In saying so, you shall but say the truth."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Then I salute you with this kingly title:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"Long live Richard, England's royal king!"
III,VII,Lord Mayor,"Amen."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?"
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Even when you please, since you will have it so."
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:"
III,VII,BUCKINGHAM,"And so most joyfully we take our leave."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Come, let us to our holy task again."
III,VII,GLOUCESTER,"Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends."
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes."
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Daughter, well met."
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"God give your graces both"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"A happy and a joyful time of day!"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"As much to you, good sister! Whither away?"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Upon the like devotion as yourselves,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"To gratulate the gentle princes there."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"How doth the prince, and my young son of York?"
IV,I,BRAKENBURY,"Right well, dear madam. By your patience,"
IV,I,BRAKENBURY,"I may not suffer you to visit them;"
IV,I,BRAKENBURY,"The king hath straitly charged the contrary."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The king! why, who's that?"
IV,I,BRAKENBURY,"I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The Lord protect him from that kingly title!"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I am their mother; who should keep me from them?"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I am their fathers mother; I will see them."
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"And take thy office from thee, on my peril."
IV,I,BRAKENBURY,"No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:"
IV,I,BRAKENBURY,"I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me."
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,"
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,"
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"And reverend looker on, of two fair queens."
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,"
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"There to be crowned Richard's royal queen."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"With this dead-killing news!"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!"
IV,I,DORSET,"Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thy mother's name is ominous to children."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Lest thou increase the number of the dead;"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen."
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam."
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"Take all the swift advantage of the hours;"
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"You shall have letters from me to my son"
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"To meet you on the way, and welcome you."
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay."
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"O ill-dispersing wind of misery!"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"O my accursed womb, the bed of death!"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Whose unavoided eye is murderous."
IV,I,LORD STANLEY,"Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent."
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"And I in all unwillingness will go."
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"I would to God that the inclusive verge"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Of golden metal that must round my brow"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Anointed let me be with deadly venom,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm."
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"No! why?  When he that is my husband now"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Which issued from my other angel husband"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"For making me, so young, so old a widow!"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"And be thy wife--if any be so mad--"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"As miserable by the life of thee"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Even in so short a space, my woman's heart"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Grossly grew captive to his honey words"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"For never yet one hour in his bed"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"But have been waked by his timorous dreams."
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining."
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"No more than from my soul I mourn for yours."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!"
IV,I,LADY ANNE,"Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,"
IV,I,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower."
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Whom envy hath immured within your walls!"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For tender princes, use my babies well!"
IV,I,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"My gracious sovereign?"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Give me thy hand."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Thus high, by thy advice"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"But shall we wear these honours for a day?"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Still live they and for ever may they last!"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"To try if thou be current gold indeed"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Young Edward lives: think now what I would say."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Say on, my loving lord."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"True, noble prince."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"O bitter consequence,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"And I would have it suddenly perform'd."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Your grace may do your pleasure."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Before I positively herein:"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"I will resolve your grace immediately."
IV,II,CATESBY,"The king is angry: see, he bites the lip."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"I will converse with iron-witted fools"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"And unrespective boys: none are for me"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"That look into me with considerate eyes:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Boy!"
IV,II,Page,"My lord?"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?"
IV,II,Page,"My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,"
IV,II,Page,"Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:"
IV,II,Page,"Gold were as good as twenty orators,"
IV,II,Page,"And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"What is his name?"
IV,II,Page,"His name, my lord, is Tyrrel."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"I partly know the man: go, call him hither."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"The deep-revolving witty Buckingham"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Hath he so long held out with me untired,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"And stops he now for breath?"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"How now! what news with you?"
IV,II,STANLEY,"My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled"
IV,II,STANLEY,"To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea"
IV,II,STANLEY,"Where he abides."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Catesby!"
IV,II,CATESBY,"My lord?"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Rumour it abroad"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"I will take order for her keeping close."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"The boy is foolish, and I fear not him."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"About it; for it stands me much upon,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"I must be married to my brother's daughter,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Murder her brothers, and then marry her!"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Uncertain way of gain! But I am in"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Is thy name Tyrrel?"
IV,II,TYRREL,"James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Art thou, indeed?"
IV,II,TYRREL,"Prove me, my gracious sovereign."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?"
IV,II,TYRREL,"Ay, my lord;"
IV,II,TYRREL,"But I had rather kill two enemies."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Are they that I would have thee deal upon:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower."
IV,II,TYRREL,"Let me have open means to come to them,"
IV,II,TYRREL,"And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"There is no more but so: say it is done,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"And I will love thee, and prefer thee too."
IV,II,TYRREL,"'Tis done, my gracious lord."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?"
IV,II,TYRREL,"Ye shall, my Lord."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"The late demand that you did sound me in."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"I hear that news, my lord."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"The earldom of Hereford and the moveables"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"The which you promised I should possess."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"What says your highness to my just demand?"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"As I remember, Henry the Sixth"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"When Richmond was a little peevish boy."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"A king, perhaps, perhaps,--"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"My lord!"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"How chance the prophet could not at that time"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, your promise for the earldom,--"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Because a bard of Ireland told me once"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"I should not live long after I saw Richmond."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"My Lord!"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Ay, what's o'clock?"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"I am thus bold to put your grace in mind"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Of what you promised me."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Well, but what's o'clock?"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Upon the stroke of ten."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Well, let it strike."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Why let it strike?"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Betwixt thy begging and my meditation."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"I am not in the giving vein to-day."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Why, then resolve me whether you will or no."
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Tut, tut,"
IV,II,KING RICHARD III,"Thou troublest me; am not in the vein."
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"Is it even so? rewards he my true service"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"With such deep contempt made I him king for this?"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone"
IV,II,BUCKINGHAM,"To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!"
IV,III,TYRREL,"The tyrannous and bloody deed is done."
IV,III,TYRREL,"The most arch of piteous massacre"
IV,III,TYRREL,"That ever yet this land was guilty of."
IV,III,TYRREL,"Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn"
IV,III,TYRREL,"To do this ruthless piece of butchery,"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Melting with tenderness and kind compassion"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories."
IV,III,TYRREL,"'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'"
IV,III,TYRREL,"'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Within their innocent alabaster arms:"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other."
IV,III,TYRREL,"A book of prayers on their pillow lay;"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;"
IV,III,TYRREL,"But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered"
IV,III,TYRREL,"The most replenished sweet work of nature,"
IV,III,TYRREL,"That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;"
IV,III,TYRREL,"They could not speak; and so I left them both,"
IV,III,TYRREL,"To bring this tidings to the bloody king."
IV,III,TYRREL,"And here he comes."
IV,III,TYRREL,"All hail, my sovereign liege!"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?"
IV,III,TYRREL,"If to have done the thing you gave in charge"
IV,III,TYRREL,"Beget your happiness, be happy then,"
IV,III,TYRREL,"For it is done, my lord."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"But didst thou see them dead?"
IV,III,TYRREL,"I did, my lord."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"And buried, gentle Tyrrel?"
IV,III,TYRREL,"The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;"
IV,III,TYRREL,"But how or in what place I do not know."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"And thou shalt tell the process of their death."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"And be inheritor of thy desire."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Farewell till soon."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"The son of Clarence have I pent up close;"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer."
IV,III,CATESBY,"My lord!"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?"
IV,III,CATESBY,"Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;"
IV,III,CATESBY,"And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,"
IV,III,CATESBY,"Is in the field, and still his power increaseth."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Ely with Richmond troubles me more near"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army."
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Come, I have heard that fearful commenting"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Is leaden servitor to dull delay;"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Then fiery expedition be my wing,"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;"
IV,III,KING RICHARD III,"We must be brief when traitors brave the field."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"So, now prosperity begins to mellow"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And drop into the rotten mouth of death."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"To watch the waning of mine adversaries."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"A dire induction am I witness to,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And will to France, hoping the consequence"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If yet your gentle souls fly in the air"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Hover about me with your airy wings"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And hear your mother's lamentation!"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hover about her; say, that right for right"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"So many miseries have crazed my voice,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward for Edward pays a dying debt."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"When holy Harry died, and my sweet son."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Brief abstract and record of tedious days,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"If ancient sorrow be most reverend,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Give mine the benefit of seniory,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And let my woes frown on the upper hand."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"If sorrow can admit society,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That foul defacer of God's handiwork,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"O upright, just, and true-disposing God,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Preys on the issue of his mother's body,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"God witness with me, I have wept for thine."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And now I cloy me with beholding it."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Young York he is but boot, because both they"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Match not the high perfection of my loss:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And the beholders of this tragic play,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Only reserved their factor, to buy souls"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"To have him suddenly convey'd away."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"That I may live to say, The dog is dead!"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O, thou didst prophesy the time would come"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That I should wish for thee to help me curse"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"The presentation of but what I was;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"The flattering index of a direful pageant;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"A sign of dignity, a garish flag,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"To be the aim of every dangerous shot,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"A queen in jest, only to fill the scene."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Decline all this, and see what now thou art:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"For happy wife, a most distressed widow;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"For joyful mother, one that wails the name;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"For one commanding all, obey'd of none."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And left thee but a very prey to time;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Having no more but thought of what thou wert,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"To torture thee the more, being what thou art."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"From which even here I slip my weary neck,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And leave the burthen of it all on thee."
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"These English woes will make me smile in France."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And teach me how to curse mine enemies!"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Compare dead happiness with living woe;"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"And he that slew them fouler than he is:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Revolving this will teach thee how to curse."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!"
IV,IV,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Why should calamity be full of words?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Windy attorneys to their client woes,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Airy succeeders of intestate joys,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Poor breathing orators of miseries!"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Let them have scope: though what they do impart"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Help not all, yet do they ease the heart."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And in the breath of bitter words let's smother"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Who intercepts my expedition?"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"O, she that might have intercepted thee,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"By strangling thee in her accursed womb"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Where should be graven, if that right were right,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Either be patient, and entreat me fair,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Or with the clamorous report of war"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Thus will I drown your exclamations."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Art thou my son?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Then patiently hear my impatience."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Madam, I have a touch of your condition,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Which cannot brook the accent of reproof."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"O, let me speak!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Do then: but I'll not hear."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I will be mild and gentle in my speech."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And brief, good mother; for I am in haste."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"God knows, in anguish, pain and agony."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And came I not at last to comfort you?"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"treacherous,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"What comfortable hour canst thou name,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That ever graced me in thy company?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"your grace"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To breakfast once forth of my company."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"If I be so disgracious in your sight,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Let me march on, and not offend your grace."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Strike the drum."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I prithee, hear me speak."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"You speak too bitterly."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Hear me a word;"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"For I shall never speak to thee again."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"So."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And never look upon thy face again."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"My prayers on the adverse party fight;"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And there the little souls of Edward's children"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Whisper the spirits of thine enemies"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And promise them success and victory."
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;"
IV,IV,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Abides in me; I say amen to all."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I have no more sons of the royal blood"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And therefore level not to hit their lives."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And must she die for this? O, let her live,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Throw over her the veil of infamy:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I will confess she was not Edward's daughter."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To save her life, I'll say she is not so."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Her life is only safest in her birth."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And only in that safety died her brothers."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Lo, at their births good stars were opposite."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"No, to their lives bad friends were contrary."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"All unavoided is the doom of destiny."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"True, when avoided grace makes destiny:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My babes were destined to a fairer death,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"You speak as if that I had slain my cousins."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To revel in the entrails of my lambs."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And I, in such a desperate bay of death,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And dangerous success of bloody wars,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"As I intend more good to you and yours,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To be discover'd, that can do me good?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"The advancement of your children, gentle lady."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"No, to the dignity and height of honour"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"The high imperial type of this earth's glory."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Flatter my sorrows with report of it;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Canst thou demise to any child of mine?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Will I withal endow a child of thine;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"So in the Lethe of thy angry soul"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Which thou supposest I have done to thee."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Last longer telling than thy kindness' date."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"What do you think?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And mean to make her queen of England."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Even he that makes her queen who should be else?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What, thou?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"I, even I: what think you of it, madam?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"How canst thou woo her?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"That would I learn of you,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"As one that are best acquainted with her humour."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And wilt thou learn of me?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Madam, with all my heart."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Edward and York; then haply she will weep:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The purple sap from her sweet brother's body"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If this inducement force her not to love,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Send her a story of thy noble acts;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To win our daughter."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"There is no other way"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And not be Richard that hath done all this."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Say that I did all this for love of her."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Having bought love with such a bloody spoil."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Look, what is done cannot be now amended:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Which after hours give leisure to repent."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"If I did take the kingdom from your sons,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To quicken your increase, I will beget"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"A grandam's name is little less in love"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Than is the doting title of a mother;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"They are as children but one step below,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Even of your mettle, of your very blood;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Of an one pain, save for a night of groans"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Your children were vexation to your youth,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"But mine shall be a comfort to your age."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"The loss you have is but a son being king,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And by that loss your daughter is made queen."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"I cannot make you what amends I would,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Therefore accept such kindness as I can."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"This fair alliance quickly shall call home"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To high promotions and great dignity:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Again shall you be mother to a king,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And all the ruins of distressful times"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Repair'd with double riches of content."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"What! we have many goodly days to see:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"The liquid drops of tears that you have shed"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Advantaging their loan with interest"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Of ten times double gain of happiness."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Make bold her bashful years with your experience;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And when this arm of mine hath chastised"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Bound with triumphant garlands will I come"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To whom I will retail my conquest won,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What were I best to say? her father's brother"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Under what title shall I woo for thee,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That God, the law, my honour and her love,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Infer fair England's peace by this alliance."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Which she shall purchase with still lasting war."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Say that the king, which may command, entreats."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That at her hands which the king's King forbids."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To wail the tide, as her mother doth."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Say, I will love her everlastingly."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But how long shall that title 'ever' last?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"So long as heaven and nature lengthens it."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So long as hell and Richard likes of it."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Be eloquent in my behalf to her."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"An honest tale speeds best being plainly told."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Plain and not honest is too harsh a style."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Your reasons are too shallow and too quick."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Harp not on that string, madam; that is past."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"I swear--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"By nothing; for this is no oath:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"if something thou wilt swear to be believed,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Now, by the world--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"'Tis full of thy foul wrongs."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"My father's death--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thy life hath that dishonour'd."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Then, by myself--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thyself thyself misusest."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Why then, by God--"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"God's wrong is most of all."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The unity the king thy brother made"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Had graced the tender temples of my child,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And both the princes had been breathing here,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What canst thou swear by now?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"The time to come."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For I myself have many tears to wash"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The children live, whose parents thou hast"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"slaughter'd,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast"
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"As I intend to prosper and repent,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"So thrive I in my dangerous attempt"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Be opposite all planets of good luck"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"In her consists my happiness and thine;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Without her, follows to this land and me,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Death, desolation, ruin and decay:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"It cannot be avoided but by this;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"It will not be avoided but by this."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Be the attorney of my love to her:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Plead what I will be, not what I have been;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Urge the necessity and state of times,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And be not peevish-fond in great designs."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Shall I forget myself to be myself?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But thou didst kill my children."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"But in your daughter's womb I bury them:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Selves of themselves, to your recomforture."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And be a happy mother by the deed."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I go. Write to me very shortly."
IV,IV,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And you shall understand from me her mind."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"How now! what news?"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"My gracious sovereign, on the western coast"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"And there they hull, expecting but the aid"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?"
IV,IV,CATESBY,"Here, my lord."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Fly to the duke:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Post thou to Salisbury"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"When thou comest thither--"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Dull, unmindful villain,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?"
IV,IV,CATESBY,"First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,"
IV,IV,CATESBY,"What from your grace I shall deliver to him."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"The greatest strength and power he can make,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And meet me presently at Salisbury."
IV,IV,CATESBY,"I go."
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"Salisbury?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?"
IV,IV,RATCLIFF,"Your highness told me I should post before."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"How now, what news with you?"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"Nor none so bad, but it may well be told."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Why dost thou run so many mile about,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Once more, what news?"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"Richmond is on the seas."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"There let him sink, and be the seas on him!"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"He makes for England, there to claim the crown."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"What heir of York is there alive but we?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And who is England's king but great York's heir?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Unless for that he comes to be your liege,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear."
IV,IV,STANLEY,"No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Where are thy tenants and thy followers?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Are they not now upon the western shore."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"No, my good lord, my friends are in the north."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"When they should serve their sovereign in the west?"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"Please it your majesty to give me leave,"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"Where and what time your majesty shall please."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"I will not trust you, sir."
IV,IV,STANLEY,"Most mighty sovereign,"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:"
IV,IV,STANLEY,"I never was nor never will be false."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Well,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Or else his head's assurance is but frail."
IV,IV,STANLEY,"So deal with him as I prove true to you."
IV,IV,Messenger,"My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,"
IV,IV,Messenger,"As I by friends am well advertised,"
IV,IV,Messenger,"Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate"
IV,IV,Messenger,"Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,"
IV,IV,Messenger,"With many more confederates, are in arms."
IV,IV,Second Messenger,"My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;"
IV,IV,Second Messenger,"And every hour more competitors"
IV,IV,Second Messenger,"Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth."
IV,IV,Third Messenger,"My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Take that, until thou bring me better news."
IV,IV,Third Messenger,"The news I have to tell your majesty"
IV,IV,Third Messenger,"Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,"
IV,IV,Third Messenger,"Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;"
IV,IV,Third Messenger,"And he himself wander'd away alone,"
IV,IV,Third Messenger,"No man knows whither."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"I cry thee mercy:"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"There is my purse to cure that blow of thine."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Reward to him that brings the traitor in?"
IV,IV,Third Messenger,"Such proclamation hath been made, my liege."
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,"
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms."
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,"
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:"
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat"
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks"
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"If they were his assistants, yea or no;"
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham."
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,"
IV,IV,Fourth Messenger,"Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"March on, march on, since we are up in arms;"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"If not to fight with foreign enemies,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Yet to beat down these rebels here at home."
IV,IV,CATESBY,"My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;"
IV,IV,CATESBY,"That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond"
IV,IV,CATESBY,"Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,"
IV,IV,CATESBY,"Is colder tidings, yet they must be told."
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"A royal battle might be won and lost"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Some one take order Buckingham be brought"
IV,IV,KING RICHARD III,"To Salisbury; the rest march on with me."
IV,V,DERBY,"Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:"
IV,V,DERBY,"That in the sty of this most bloody boar"
IV,V,DERBY,"My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:"
IV,V,DERBY,"If I revolt, off goes young George's head;"
IV,V,DERBY,"The fear of that withholds my present aid."
IV,V,DERBY,"But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?"
IV,V,CHRISTOPHER,"At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales."
IV,V,DERBY,"What men of name resort to him?"
IV,V,CHRISTOPHER,"Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;"
IV,V,CHRISTOPHER,"Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;"
IV,V,CHRISTOPHER,"Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,"
IV,V,CHRISTOPHER,"And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;"
IV,V,CHRISTOPHER,"And many more of noble fame and worth:"
IV,V,CHRISTOPHER,"And towards London they do bend their course,"
IV,V,CHRISTOPHER,"If by the way they be not fought withal."
IV,V,DERBY,"Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:"
IV,V,DERBY,"Tell him the queen hath heartily consented"
IV,V,DERBY,"He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter."
IV,V,DERBY,"These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell."
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Will not King Richard let me speak with him?"
V,I,Sheriff,"No, my good lord; therefore be patient."
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Vaughan, and all that have miscarried"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"By underhand corrupted foul injustice,"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"If that your moody discontented souls"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Do through the clouds behold this present hour,"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Even for revenge mock my destruction!"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?"
V,I,Sheriff,"It is, my lord."
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday."
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"This is the day that, in King Edward's time,"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"I wish't might fall on me, when I was found"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"False to his children or his wife's allies"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"By the false faith of him I trusted most;"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Is the determined respite of my wrongs:"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"That high All-Seer that I dallied with"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest."
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;"
V,I,BUCKINGHAM,"Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame."
V,II,RICHMOND,"Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,"
V,II,RICHMOND,"Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,"
V,II,RICHMOND,"Thus far into the bowels of the land"
V,II,RICHMOND,"Have we march'd on without impediment;"
V,II,RICHMOND,"And here receive we from our father Stanley"
V,II,RICHMOND,"Lines of fair comfort and encouragement."
V,II,RICHMOND,"The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,"
V,II,RICHMOND,"That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,"
V,II,RICHMOND,"Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough"
V,II,RICHMOND,"In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine"
V,II,RICHMOND,"Lies now even in the centre of this isle,"
V,II,RICHMOND,"Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn"
V,II,RICHMOND,"From Tamworth thither is but one day's march."
V,II,RICHMOND,"In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,"
V,II,RICHMOND,"To reap the harvest of perpetual peace"
V,II,RICHMOND,"By this one bloody trial of sharp war."

V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?"
V,III,SURREY,"My heart is ten times lighter than my looks."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"My Lord of Norfolk,--"
V,III,NORFOLK,"Here, most gracious liege."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?"
V,III,NORFOLK,"We must both give and take, my gracious lord."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Who hath descried the number of the foe?"
V,III,NORFOLK,"Six or seven thousand is their utmost power."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Why, our battalion trebles that account:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Which they upon the adverse party want."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Let us survey the vantage of the field"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Call for some men of sound direction"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Let's want no discipline, make no delay,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day."
V,III,RICHMOND,"The weary sun hath made a golden set,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"And by the bright track of his fiery car,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow."
V,III,RICHMOND,"Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard."
V,III,RICHMOND,"Give me some ink and paper in my tent"
V,III,RICHMOND,"I'll draw the form and model of our battle,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Limit each leader to his several charge,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"And part in just proportion our small strength."
V,III,RICHMOND,"My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me."
V,III,RICHMOND,"The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him"
V,III,RICHMOND,"And by the second hour in the morning"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Desire the earl to see me in my tent:"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?"
V,III,BLUNT,"Unless I have mista'en his colours much,"
V,III,BLUNT,"Which well I am assured I have not done,"
V,III,BLUNT,"His regiment lies half a mile at least"
V,III,BLUNT,"South from the mighty power of the king."
V,III,RICHMOND,"If without peril it be possible,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"And give him from me this most needful scroll."
V,III,BLUNT,"Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;"
V,III,BLUNT,"And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Let us consult upon to-morrow's business"
V,III,RICHMOND,"In to our tent; the air is raw and cold."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"What is't o'clock?"
V,III,CATESBY,"It's supper-time, my lord;"
V,III,CATESBY,"It's nine o'clock."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"I will not sup to-night."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Give me some ink and paper."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"What, is my beaver easier than it was?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"And all my armour laid into my tent?"
V,III,CATESBY,"If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels."
V,III,NORFOLK,"I go, my lord."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk."
V,III,NORFOLK,"I warrant you, my lord."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Catesby!"
V,III,CATESBY,"My lord?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Send out a pursuivant at arms"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Before sunrising, lest his son George fall"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Into the blind cave of eternal night."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Ratcliff!"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"My lord?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"I have not that alacrity of spirit,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"It is, my lord."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Bid my guard watch; leave me."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"And help to arm me. Leave me, I say."
V,III,DERBY,"Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!"
V,III,RICHMOND,"All comfort that the dark night can afford"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Tell me, how fares our loving mother?"
V,III,DERBY,"I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother"
V,III,DERBY,"Who prays continually for Richmond's good:"
V,III,DERBY,"So much for that. The silent hours steal on,"
V,III,DERBY,"And flaky darkness breaks within the east."
V,III,DERBY,"In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--"
V,III,DERBY,"Prepare thy battle early in the morning,"
V,III,DERBY,"And put thy fortune to the arbitrement"
V,III,DERBY,"Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war."
V,III,DERBY,"I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--"
V,III,DERBY,"With best advantage will deceive the time,"
V,III,DERBY,"And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:"
V,III,DERBY,"But on thy side I may not be too forward"
V,III,DERBY,"Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,"
V,III,DERBY,"Be executed in his father's sight."
V,III,DERBY,"Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time"
V,III,DERBY,"Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love"
V,III,DERBY,"And ample interchange of sweet discourse,"
V,III,DERBY,"Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:"
V,III,DERBY,"God give us leisure for these rites of love!"
V,III,DERBY,"Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:"
V,III,RICHMOND,"I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"When I should mount with wings of victory:"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen."
V,III,RICHMOND,"O Thou, whose captain I account myself,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Look on my forces with a gracious eye;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"That they may crush down with a heavy fall"
V,III,RICHMOND,"The usurping helmets of our adversaries!"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Make us thy ministers of chastisement,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"That we may praise thee in the victory!"
V,III,RICHMOND,"To thee I do commend my watchful soul,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:"

V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?"

V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Find in myself no pity to myself?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Came to my tent; and every one did threat"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard."
V,III,RATCLIFF,"My lord!"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"'Zounds! who is there?"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"Hath twice done salutation to the morn;"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!"

V,III,KING RICHARD III,"By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"To see if any mean to shrink from me."
V,III,LORDS,"Good morrow, Richmond!"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here."
V,III,LORDS,"How have you slept, my lord?"
V,III,RICHMOND,"The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams"
V,III,RICHMOND,"That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Have I since your departure had, my lords."
V,III,RICHMOND,"Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Came to my tent, and cried on victory:"
V,III,RICHMOND,"I promise you, my soul is very jocund"
V,III,RICHMOND,"In the remembrance of so fair a dream."
V,III,RICHMOND,"How far into the morning is it, lords?"
V,III,LORDS,"Upon the stroke of four."
V,III,RICHMOND,"Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction."
V,III,RICHMOND,"More than I have said, loving countrymen,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"The leisure and enforcement of the time"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"God and our good cause fight upon our side;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Richard except, those whom we fight against"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Had rather have us win than him they follow:"
V,III,RICHMOND,"For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"A bloody tyrant and a homicide;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"One that made means to come by what he hath,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"One that hath ever been God's enemy:"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Then, if you fight against God's enemy,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"If you do fight against your country's foes,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"If you do free your children from the sword,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Your children's children quit it in your age."
V,III,RICHMOND,"Then, in the name of God and all these rights,"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Advance your standards, draw your willing swords."
V,III,RICHMOND,"For me, the ransom of my bold attempt"
V,III,RICHMOND,"Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt"
V,III,RICHMOND,"The least of you shall share his part thereof."
V,III,RICHMOND,"Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;"
V,III,RICHMOND,"God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"That he was never trained up in arms."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"He was in the right; and so indeed it is."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Who saw the sun to-day?"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"Not I, my lord."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Then he disdains to shine; for by the book"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"He should have braved the east an hour ago"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!"
V,III,RATCLIFF,"My lord?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"The sun will not be seen to-day;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"The sky doth frown and lour upon our army."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"I would these dewy tears were from the ground."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"That frowns on me looks sadly upon him."
V,III,NORFOLK,"Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"And thus my battle shall be ordered:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Consisting equally of horse and foot;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Our archers shall be placed in the midst"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Shall have the leading of this foot and horse."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"They thus directed, we will follow"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"In the main battle, whose puissance on either side"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?"
V,III,NORFOLK,"A good direction, warlike sovereign."
V,III,NORFOLK,"This found I on my tent this morning."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"A thing devised by the enemy."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Conscience is but a word that cowards use,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Remember whom you are to cope withal;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"To desperate ventures and assured destruction."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"They would restrain the one, distain the other."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"A milk-sop, one that never in his life"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Lash hence these overweening rags of France,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"And in record, left them the heirs of shame."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Ravish our daughters?"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Hark! I hear their drum."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?"
V,III,Messenger,"My lord, he doth deny to come."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Off with his son George's head!"
V,III,NORFOLK,"My lord, the enemy is past the marsh"
V,III,NORFOLK,"After the battle let George Stanley die."
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Advance our standards, set upon our foes"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!"
V,III,KING RICHARD III,"Upon them! victory sits on our helms."
V,IV,CATESBY,"Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!"
V,IV,CATESBY,"The king enacts more wonders than a man,"
V,IV,CATESBY,"Daring an opposite to every danger:"
V,IV,CATESBY,"His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,"
V,IV,CATESBY,"Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death."
V,IV,CATESBY,"Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!"
V,IV,KING RICHARD III,"A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!"
V,IV,CATESBY,"Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse."
V,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,"
V,IV,KING RICHARD III,"And I will stand the hazard of the die:"
V,IV,KING RICHARD III,"I think there be six Richmonds in the field;"
V,IV,KING RICHARD III,"Five have I slain to-day instead of him."
V,IV,KING RICHARD III,"A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!"
V,V,RICHMOND,"God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead."
V,V,DERBY,"Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee."
V,V,DERBY,"Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty"
V,V,DERBY,"From the dead temples of this bloody wretch"
V,V,DERBY,"Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:"
V,V,DERBY,"Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it."
V,V,RICHMOND,"Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!"
V,V,RICHMOND,"But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?"
V,V,DERBY,"He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;"
V,V,DERBY,"Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us."
V,V,RICHMOND,"What men of name are slain on either side?"
V,V,DERBY,"John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,"
V,V,DERBY,"Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon."
V,V,RICHMOND,"Inter their bodies as becomes their births:"
V,V,RICHMOND,"Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled"
V,V,RICHMOND,"That in submission will return to us:"
V,V,RICHMOND,"And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"We will unite the white rose and the red:"
V,V,RICHMOND,"Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"That long have frown'd upon their enmity!"
V,V,RICHMOND,"What traitor hears me, and says not amen?"
V,V,RICHMOND,"England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;"
V,V,RICHMOND,"The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:"
V,V,RICHMOND,"All this divided York and Lancaster,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"Divided in their dire division,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"The true succeeders of each royal house,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!"
V,V,RICHMOND,"And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so."
V,V,RICHMOND,"Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!"
V,V,RICHMOND,"Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"That would reduce these bloody days again,"
V,V,RICHMOND,"And make poor England weep in streams of blood!"
V,V,RICHMOND,"Let them not live to taste this land's increase"
V,V,RICHMOND,"That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!"
V,V,RICHMOND,"Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:"
V,V,RICHMOND,"That she may long live here, God say amen!"
