I,I,First Gentleman,"You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods"
I,I,First Gentleman,"No more obey the heavens than our courtiers"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Still seem as does the king."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"But what's the matter?"
I,I,First Gentleman,"His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom"
I,I,First Gentleman,"He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow"
I,I,First Gentleman,"That late he married--hath referr'd herself"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Is outward sorrow; though I think the king"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Be touch'd at very heart."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"None but the king?"
I,I,First Gentleman,"He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"That most desired the match; but not a courtier,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Although they wear their faces to the bent"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Glad at the thing they scowl at."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"And why so?"
I,I,First Gentleman,"He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--"
I,I,First Gentleman,"I mean, that married her, alack, good man!"
I,I,First Gentleman,"And therefore banish'd--is a creature such"
I,I,First Gentleman,"As, to seek through the regions of the earth"
I,I,First Gentleman,"For one his like, there would be something failing"
I,I,First Gentleman,"In him that should compare. I do not think"
I,I,First Gentleman,"So fair an outward and such stuff within"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Endows a man but he."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"You speak him far."
I,I,First Gentleman,"I do extend him, sir, within himself,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Crush him together rather than unfold"
I,I,First Gentleman,"His measure duly."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"What's his name and birth?"
I,I,First Gentleman,"I cannot delve him to the root: his father"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Against the Romans with Cassibelan,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"But had his titles by Tenantius whom"
I,I,First Gentleman,"He served with glory and admired success,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;"
I,I,First Gentleman,"And had, besides this gentleman in question,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Died with their swords in hand; for which"
I,I,First Gentleman,"their father,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow"
I,I,First Gentleman,"That he quit being, and his gentle lady,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased"
I,I,First Gentleman,"As he was born. The king he takes the babe"
I,I,First Gentleman,"To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Puts to him all the learnings that his time"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Could make him the receiver of; which he took,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"A sample to the youngest, to the more mature"
I,I,First Gentleman,"A glass that feated them, and to the graver"
I,I,First Gentleman,"A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"For whom he now is banish'd, her own price"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;"
I,I,First Gentleman,"By her election may be truly read"
I,I,First Gentleman,"What kind of man he is."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"I honour him"
I,I,Second Gentleman,"Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,"
I,I,Second Gentleman,"Is she sole child to the king?"
I,I,First Gentleman,"His only child."
I,I,First Gentleman,"He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Which way they went."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"How long is this ago?"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Some twenty years."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"That a king's children should be so convey'd,"
I,I,Second Gentleman,"So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,"
I,I,Second Gentleman,"That could not trace them!"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Howsoe'er 'tis strange,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"Yet is it true, sir."
I,I,Second Gentleman,"I do well believe you."
I,I,First Gentleman,"We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,"
I,I,First Gentleman,"The queen, and princess."
I,I,QUEEN,"No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,"
I,I,QUEEN,"After the slander of most stepmothers,"
I,I,QUEEN,"Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but"
I,I,QUEEN,"Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys"
I,I,QUEEN,"That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,"
I,I,QUEEN,"So soon as I can win the offended king,"
I,I,QUEEN,"I will be known your advocate: marry, yet"
I,I,QUEEN,"The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good"
I,I,QUEEN,"You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience"
I,I,QUEEN,"Your wisdom may inform you."
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Please your highness,"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I will from hence to-day."
I,I,QUEEN,"You know the peril."
I,I,QUEEN,"I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying"
I,I,QUEEN,"The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king"
I,I,QUEEN,"Hath charged you should not speak together."
I,I,IMOGEN,"O"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,"
I,I,IMOGEN,"I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Always reserved my holy duty--what"
I,I,IMOGEN,"His rage can do on me: you must be gone;"
I,I,IMOGEN,"And I shall here abide the hourly shot"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,"
I,I,IMOGEN,"But that there is this jewel in the world"
I,I,IMOGEN,"That I may see again."
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"My queen! my mistress!"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To be suspected of more tenderness"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than doth become a man. I will remain"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"My residence in Rome at one Philario's,"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who to my father was a friend, to me"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Though ink be made of gall."
I,I,QUEEN,"Be brief, I pray you:"
I,I,QUEEN,"If the king come, I shall incur I know not"
I,I,QUEEN,"How much of his displeasure."
I,I,QUEEN,"Yet I'll move him"
I,I,QUEEN,"To walk this way: I never do him wrong,"
I,I,QUEEN,"But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;"
I,I,QUEEN,"Pays dear for my offences."
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Should we be taking leave"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As long a term as yet we have to live,"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Nay, stay a little:"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Were you but riding forth to air yourself,"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;"
I,I,IMOGEN,"This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;"
I,I,IMOGEN,"But keep it till you woo another wife,"
I,I,IMOGEN,"When Imogen is dead."
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"How, how! another?"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You gentle gods, give me but this I have,"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And sear up my embracements from a next"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"With bonds of death!"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Remain, remain thou here"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As I my poor self did exchange for you,"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I still win of you: for my sake wear this;"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is a manacle of love; I'll place it"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Upon this fairest prisoner."
I,I,IMOGEN,"O the gods!"
I,I,IMOGEN,"When shall we see again?"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Alack, the king!"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"If after this command thou fraught the court"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"Thou'rt poison to my blood."
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The gods protect you!"
I,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone."
I,I,IMOGEN,"There cannot be a pinch in death"
I,I,IMOGEN,"More sharp than this is."
I,I,CYMBELINE,"O disloyal thing,"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"A year's age on me."
I,I,IMOGEN,"I beseech you, sir,"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Harm not yourself with your vexation"
I,I,IMOGEN,"I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Subdues all pangs, all fears."
I,I,CYMBELINE,"Past grace? obedience?"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace."
I,I,CYMBELINE,"That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!"
I,I,IMOGEN,"O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,"
I,I,IMOGEN,"And did avoid a puttock."
I,I,CYMBELINE,"Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"A seat for baseness."
I,I,IMOGEN,"No; I rather added"
I,I,IMOGEN,"A lustre to it."
I,I,CYMBELINE,"O thou vile one!"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Sir,"
I,I,IMOGEN,"It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:"
I,I,IMOGEN,"You bred him as my playfellow, and he is"
I,I,IMOGEN,"A man worth any woman, overbuys me"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Almost the sum he pays."
I,I,CYMBELINE,"What, art thou mad?"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were"
I,I,IMOGEN,"A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Our neighbour shepherd's son!"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"Thou foolish thing!"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"They were again together: you have done"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"Not after our command. Away with her,"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"And pen her up."
I,I,QUEEN,"Beseech your patience. Peace,"
I,I,QUEEN,"Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,"
I,I,QUEEN,"Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort"
I,I,QUEEN,"Out of your best advice."
I,I,CYMBELINE,"Nay, let her languish"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,"
I,I,CYMBELINE,"Die of this folly!"
I,I,QUEEN,"Fie! you must give way."
I,I,QUEEN,"Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?"
I,I,PISANIO,"My lord your son drew on my master."
I,I,QUEEN,"Ha!"
I,I,QUEEN,"No harm, I trust, is done?"
I,I,PISANIO,"There might have been,"
I,I,PISANIO,"But that my master rather play'd than fought"
I,I,PISANIO,"And had no help of anger: they were parted"
I,I,PISANIO,"By gentlemen at hand."
I,I,QUEEN,"I am very glad on't."
I,I,IMOGEN,"Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part."
I,I,IMOGEN,"To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!"
I,I,IMOGEN,"I would they were in Afric both together;"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Myself by with a needle, that I might prick"
I,I,IMOGEN,"The goer-back. Why came you from your master?"
I,I,PISANIO,"On his command: he would not suffer me"
I,I,PISANIO,"To bring him to the haven; left these notes"
I,I,PISANIO,"Of what commands I should be subject to,"
I,I,PISANIO,"When 't pleased you to employ me."
I,I,QUEEN,"This hath been"
I,I,QUEEN,"Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour"
I,I,QUEEN,"He will remain so."
I,I,PISANIO,"I humbly thank your highness."
I,I,QUEEN,"Pray, walk awhile."
I,I,IMOGEN,"About some half-hour hence,"
I,I,IMOGEN,"I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least"
I,I,IMOGEN,"Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me."
I,II,First Lord,"Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the"
I,II,First Lord,"violence of action hath made you reek as a"
I,II,First Lord,"sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:"
I,II,First Lord,"there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent."
I,II,CLOTEN,"If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?"
I,II,First Lord,"Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be"
I,II,First Lord,"not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt."
I,II,Second Lord,"backside the town."
I,II,CLOTEN,"The villain would not stand me."
I,II,First Lord,"Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but"
I,II,First Lord,"he added to your having; gave you some ground."
I,II,CLOTEN,"I would they had not come between us."
I,II,Second Lord,"a fool you were upon the ground."
I,II,CLOTEN,"And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!"
I,II,Second Lord,"is damned."
I,II,First Lord,"Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain"
I,II,First Lord,"go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen"
I,II,First Lord,"small reflection of her wit."
I,II,Second Lord,"reflection should hurt her."
I,II,CLOTEN,"Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some"
I,II,CLOTEN,"hurt done!"
I,II,Second Lord,"of an ass, which is no great hurt."
I,II,CLOTEN,"You'll go with us?"
I,II,First Lord,"I'll attend your lordship."
I,II,CLOTEN,"Nay, come, let's go together."
I,II,Second Lord,"Well, my lord."
I,III,IMOGEN,"I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,"
I,III,IMOGEN,"And question'dst every sail: if he should write"
I,III,IMOGEN,"And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,"
I,III,IMOGEN,"As offer'd mercy is. What was the last"
I,III,IMOGEN,"That he spake to thee?"
I,III,PISANIO,"It was his queen, his queen!"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Then waved his handkerchief?"
I,III,PISANIO,"And kiss'd it, madam."
I,III,IMOGEN,"Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!"
I,III,IMOGEN,"And that was all?"
I,III,PISANIO,"No, madam; for so long"
I,III,PISANIO,"As he could make me with this eye or ear"
I,III,PISANIO,"Distinguish him from others, he did keep"
I,III,PISANIO,"The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,"
I,III,PISANIO,"Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind"
I,III,PISANIO,"Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,"
I,III,PISANIO,"How swift his ship."
I,III,IMOGEN,"Thou shouldst have made him"
I,III,IMOGEN,"As little as a crow, or less, ere left"
I,III,IMOGEN,"To after-eye him."
I,III,PISANIO,"Madam, so I did."
I,III,IMOGEN,"I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but"
I,III,IMOGEN,"To look upon him, till the diminution"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from"
I,III,IMOGEN,"The smallness of a gnat to air, and then"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,"
I,III,IMOGEN,"When shall we hear from him?"
I,III,PISANIO,"Be assured, madam,"
I,III,PISANIO,"With his next vantage."
I,III,IMOGEN,"I did not take my leave of him, but had"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him"
I,III,IMOGEN,"How I would think on him at certain hours"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear"
I,III,IMOGEN,"The shes of Italy should not betray"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,"
I,III,IMOGEN,"At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,"
I,III,IMOGEN,"To encounter me with orisons, for then"
I,III,IMOGEN,"I am in heaven for him; or ere I could"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Give him that parting kiss which I had set"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father"
I,III,IMOGEN,"And like the tyrannous breathing of the north"
I,III,IMOGEN,"Shakes all our buds from growing."
I,III,Lady,"The queen, madam,"
I,III,Lady,"Desires your highness' company."
I,III,IMOGEN,"Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd."
I,III,IMOGEN,"I will attend the queen."
I,III,PISANIO,"Madam, I shall."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"could then have looked on him without the help of"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items."
I,IV,PHILARIO,"You speak of him when he was less furnished than now"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"he is with that which makes him both without and within."
I,IV,Frenchman,"I have seen him in France: we had very many there"
I,IV,Frenchman,"could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter."
I,IV,Frenchman,"And then his banishment."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"which else an easy battery might lay flat, for"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"acquaintance?"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"have been often bound for no less than my life."
I,IV,PHILARIO,"Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"knowing, to a stranger of his quality."
I,IV,PHILARIO,"I beseech you all, be better known to this"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing."
I,IV,Frenchman,"Sir, we have known together in Orleans."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still."
I,IV,Frenchman,"Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I"
I,IV,Frenchman,"did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity"
I,IV,Frenchman,"you should have been put together with so mortal a"
I,IV,Frenchman,"purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so"
I,IV,Frenchman,"slight and trivial a nature."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"my every action to be guided by others' experiences:"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight."
I,IV,Frenchman,"'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,"
I,IV,Frenchman,"and by such two that would by all likelihood have"
I,IV,Frenchman,"confounded one the other, or have fallen both."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?"
I,IV,Frenchman,"Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,"
I,IV,Frenchman,"which may, without contradiction, suffer the report."
I,IV,Frenchman,"It was much like an argument that fell out last"
I,IV,Frenchman,"night, where each of us fell in praise of our"
I,IV,Frenchman,"country mistresses; this gentleman at that time"
I,IV,Frenchman,"vouching--and upon warrant of bloody"
I,IV,Frenchman,"affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,"
I,IV,Frenchman,"chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable"
I,IV,Frenchman,"than any the rarest of our ladies in France."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"opinion by this worn out."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"She holds her virtue still and I my mind."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"abate her nothing, though I profess myself her"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"adorer, not her friend."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"comparison--had been something too fair and too good"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"for any lady in Britain. If she went before others"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"many I have beheld. I could not but believe she"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"excelled many: but I have not seen the most"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"precious diamond that is, nor you the lady."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"What do you esteem it at?"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More than the world enjoys."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"outprized by a trifle."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"and only the gift of the gods."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Which the gods have given you?"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which, by their graces, I will keep."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"estimations; the one is but frail and the other"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"nothing doubt you have store of thieves;"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"notwithstanding, I fear not my ring."
I,IV,PHILARIO,"Let us leave here, gentlemen."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"With five times so much conversation, I should get"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No, no."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"something: but I make my wager rather against your"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"lady in the world."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You are a great deal abused in too bold a"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"worthy of by your attempt."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"What's that?"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"deserve more; a punishment too."
I,IV,PHILARIO,"Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"better acquainted."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"approbation of what I have spoke!"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"What lady would you choose to assail?"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"that, commend me to the court where your lady is,"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"with no more advantage than the opportunity of a"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"second conference, and I will bring from thence"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"religion in you, that you fear."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"graver purpose, I hope."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"what's spoken, I swear."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring."
I,IV,PHILARIO,"I will have it no lay."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"yours: provided I have your commendation for my more"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"free entertainment."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I embrace these conditions; let us have articles"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"you make your voyage upon her and give me directly"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"to understand you have prevailed, I am no further"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"remain unseduced, you not making it appear"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"have made to her chastity you shall answer me with"
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"your sword."
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"down by lawful counsel, and straight away for"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two"
I,IV,IACHIMO,"wagers recorded."
I,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Agreed."
I,IV,Frenchman,"Will this hold, think you?"
I,IV,PHILARIO,"Signior Iachimo will not from it."
I,IV,PHILARIO,"Pray, let us follow 'em."
I,V,QUEEN,"Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;"
I,V,QUEEN,"Make haste: who has the note of them?"
I,V,First Lady,"I, madam."
I,V,QUEEN,"Dispatch."
I,V,QUEEN,"Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"But I beseech your grace, without offence,--"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Which are the movers of a languishing death;"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"But though slow, deadly?"
I,V,QUEEN,"I wonder, doctor,"
I,V,QUEEN,"Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been"
I,V,QUEEN,"Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how"
I,V,QUEEN,"To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so"
I,V,QUEEN,"That our great king himself doth woo me oft"
I,V,QUEEN,"For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--"
I,V,QUEEN,"Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet"
I,V,QUEEN,"That I did amplify my judgment in"
I,V,QUEEN,"Other conclusions? I will try the forces"
I,V,QUEEN,"Of these thy compounds on such creatures as"
I,V,QUEEN,"We count not worth the hanging, but none human,"
I,V,QUEEN,"To try the vigour of them and apply"
I,V,QUEEN,"Allayments to their act, and by them gather"
I,V,QUEEN,"Their several virtues and effects."
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Your highness"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Besides, the seeing these effects will be"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Both noisome and infectious."
I,V,QUEEN,"O, content thee."
I,V,QUEEN,"Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him"
I,V,QUEEN,"Will I first work: he's for his master,"
I,V,QUEEN,"An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!"
I,V,QUEEN,"Doctor, your service for this time is ended;"
I,V,QUEEN,"Take your own way."
I,V,CORNELIUS,"But you shall do no harm."
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"And will not trust one of her malice with"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Which first, perchance, she'll prove on"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"cats and dogs,"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"Then afterward up higher: but there is"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"No danger in what show of death it makes,"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"More than the locking-up the spirits a time,"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"With a most false effect; and I the truer,"
I,V,CORNELIUS,"So to be false with her."
I,V,QUEEN,"No further service, doctor,"
I,V,QUEEN,"Until I send for thee."
I,V,CORNELIUS,"I humbly take my leave."
I,V,QUEEN,"Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time"
I,V,QUEEN,"She will not quench and let instructions enter"
I,V,QUEEN,"Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:"
I,V,QUEEN,"When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,"
I,V,QUEEN,"I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then"
I,V,QUEEN,"As great as is thy master, greater, for"
I,V,QUEEN,"His fortunes all lie speechless and his name"
I,V,QUEEN,"Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor"
I,V,QUEEN,"Continue where he is: to shift his being"
I,V,QUEEN,"Is to exchange one misery with another,"
I,V,QUEEN,"And every day that comes comes to decay"
I,V,QUEEN,"A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,"
I,V,QUEEN,"To be depender on a thing that leans,"
I,V,QUEEN,"Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,"
I,V,QUEEN,"So much as but to prop him?"
I,V,QUEEN,"Thou takest up"
I,V,QUEEN,"Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:"
I,V,QUEEN,"It is a thing I made, which hath the king"
I,V,QUEEN,"Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know"
I,V,QUEEN,"What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;"
I,V,QUEEN,"It is an earnest of a further good"
I,V,QUEEN,"That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how"
I,V,QUEEN,"The case stands with her; do't as from thyself."
I,V,QUEEN,"Think what a chance thou changest on, but think"
I,V,QUEEN,"Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,"
I,V,QUEEN,"Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king"
I,V,QUEEN,"To any shape of thy preferment such"
I,V,QUEEN,"As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,"
I,V,QUEEN,"That set thee on to this desert, am bound"
I,V,QUEEN,"To load thy merit richly. Call my women:"
I,V,QUEEN,"Think on my words."
I,V,QUEEN,"A sly and constant knave,"
I,V,QUEEN,"Not to be shaked; the agent for his master"
I,V,QUEEN,"And the remembrancer of her to hold"
I,V,QUEEN,"The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that"
I,V,QUEEN,"Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her"
I,V,QUEEN,"Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,"
I,V,QUEEN,"Except she bend her humour, shall be assured"
I,V,QUEEN,"To taste of too."
I,V,QUEEN,"So, so: well done, well done:"
I,V,QUEEN,"The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,"
I,V,QUEEN,"Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;"
I,V,QUEEN,"Think on my words."
I,V,PISANIO,"And shall do:"
I,V,PISANIO,"But when to my good lord I prove untrue,"
I,V,PISANIO,"I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"A father cruel, and a step-dame false;"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!"
I,VI,PISANIO,"Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,"
I,VI,PISANIO,"Comes from my lord with letters."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Change you, madam?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The worthy Leonatus is in safety"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"And greets your highness dearly."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Thanks, good sir:"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"You're kindly welcome."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"She is alone the Arabian bird, and I"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Rather directly fly."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"him accordingly, as you value your trust--"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"LEONATUS.'"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"So far I read aloud:"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"But even the very middle of my heart"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Have words to bid you, and shall find it so"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"In all that I can do."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Thanks, fairest lady."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Upon the number'd beach? and can we not"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Partition make with spectacles so precious"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"'Twixt fair and foul?"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"What makes your admiration?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"For idiots in this case of favour would"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Should make desire vomit emptiness,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Not so allured to feed."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"What is the matter, trow?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The cloyed will,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Longs after for the garbage."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"What, dear sir,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Thus raps you? Are you well?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Thanks, madam; well."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Beseech you, sir, desire"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"My man's abode where I did leave him: he"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Is strange and peevish."
I,VI,PISANIO,"I was going, sir,"
I,VI,PISANIO,"To give him welcome."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Well, madam."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The Briton reveller."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"When he was here,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"He did incline to sadness, and oft-times"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Not knowing why."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"I never saw him sad."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"There is a Frenchman his companion, one"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"By history, report, or his own proof,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"But must be, will his free hours languish for"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Assured bondage?'"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Will my lord say so?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"It is a recreation to be by"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Some men are much to blame."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Not he, I hope."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"In you, which I account his beyond all talents,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To pity too."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"What do you pity, sir?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Two creatures heartily."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Am I one, sir?"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"You look on me: what wreck discern you in me"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Deserves your pity?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Lamentable! What,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To hide me from the radiant sun and solace"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"I' the dungeon by a snuff?"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"I pray you, sir,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Deliver with more openness your answers"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"To my demands. Why do you pity me?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That others do--"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"I was about to say--enjoy your--But"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"It is an office of the gods to venge it,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Not mine to speak on 't."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"You do seem to know"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Since doubling things go ill often hurts more"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Than to be sure they do; for certainties"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"The remedy then born--discover to me"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"What both you spur and stop."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Had I this cheek"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To the oath of loyalty; this object, which"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Slaver with lips as common as the stairs"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"With labour; then by-peeping in an eye"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Base and unlustrous as the smoky light"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That all the plagues of hell should at one time"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Encounter such revolt."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"My lord, I fear,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Has forgot Britain."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"And himself. Not I,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Charms this report out."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Let me hear no more."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That play with all infirmities for gold"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"As well might poison poison! Be revenged;"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Or she that bore you was no queen, and you"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Recoil from your great stock."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Revenged!"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"How should I be revenged? If this be true,--"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"As I have such a heart that both mine ears"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"How should I be revenged?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Should he make me"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"More noble than that runagate to your bed,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"And will continue fast to your affection,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Still close as sure."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"What, ho, Pisanio!"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Let me my service tender on your lips."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Away! I do condemn mine ears that have"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"From thy report as thou from honour, and"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Solicit'st here a lady that disdains"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"The king my father shall be made acquainted"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"A saucy stranger in his court to mart"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"As in a Romish stew and to expound"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"His beastly mind to us, he hath a court"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"He little cares for and a daughter who"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"O happy Leonatus! I may say"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The credit that thy lady hath of thee"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"A lady to the worthiest sir that ever"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"I have spoke this, to know if your affiance"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That which he is, new o'er: and he is one"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The truest manner'd; such a holy witch"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"That he enchants societies into him;"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Half all men's hearts are his."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"You make amends."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"He hath a kind of honour sets him off,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Most mighty princess, that I have adventured"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To try your taking a false report; which hath"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"In the election of a sir so rare,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"All's well, sir: take my power i' the court"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"for yours."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"My humble thanks. I had almost forgot"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To entreat your grace but in a small request,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"And yet of moment to, for it concerns"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Your lord; myself and other noble friends,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Are partners in the business."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Pray, what is't?"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To buy a present for the emperor"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Which I, the factor for the rest, have done"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"And I am something curious, being strange,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To have them in safe stowage: may it please you"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To take them in protection?"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Willingly;"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"And pawn mine honour for their safety: since"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"In my bedchamber."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"They are in a trunk,"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Attended by my men: I will make bold"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To send them to you, only for this night;"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"I must aboard to-morrow."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"O, no, no."
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"By lengthening my return. From Gallia"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To see your grace."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"I thank you for your pains:"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"But not away to-morrow!"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"O, I must, madam:"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"I have outstood my time; which is material"
I,VI,IACHIMO,"To the tender of our present."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"I will write."
I,VI,IMOGEN,"Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,"
I,VI,IMOGEN,"And truly yielded you. You're very welcome."
II,I,CLOTEN,"Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the"
II,I,CLOTEN,"jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a"
II,I,CLOTEN,"hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes"
II,I,CLOTEN,"must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine"
II,I,CLOTEN,"oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure."
II,I,First Lord,"What got he by that? You have broke his pate with"
II,I,First Lord,"your bowl."
II,I,Second Lord,"it would have run all out."
II,I,CLOTEN,"When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for"
II,I,CLOTEN,"any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?"
II,I,Second Lord,"No my lord;"
II,I,Second Lord,"nor crop the ears of them."
II,I,CLOTEN,"Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?"
II,I,CLOTEN,"Would he had been one of my rank!"
II,I,CLOTEN,"I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a"
II,I,CLOTEN,"pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;"
II,I,CLOTEN,"they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my"
II,I,CLOTEN,"mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of"
II,I,CLOTEN,"fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that"
II,I,CLOTEN,"nobody can match."
II,I,Second Lord,"cock, with your comb on."
II,I,CLOTEN,"Sayest thou?"
II,I,Second Lord,"It is not fit your lordship should undertake every"
II,I,Second Lord,"companion that you give offence to."
II,I,CLOTEN,"No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit"
II,I,CLOTEN,"offence to my inferiors."
II,I,Second Lord,"Ay, it is fit for your lordship only."
II,I,CLOTEN,"Why, so I say."
II,I,First Lord,"Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?"
II,I,CLOTEN,"A stranger, and I not know on't!"
II,I,Second Lord,"not."
II,I,First Lord,"There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of"
II,I,First Lord,"Leonatus' friends."
II,I,CLOTEN,"Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,"
II,I,CLOTEN,"whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?"
II,I,First Lord,"One of your lordship's pages."
II,I,CLOTEN,"Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no"
II,I,CLOTEN,"derogation in't?"
II,I,Second Lord,"You cannot derogate, my lord."
II,I,CLOTEN,"Not easily, I think."
II,I,Second Lord,"issues, being foolish, do not derogate."
II,I,CLOTEN,"Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost"
II,I,CLOTEN,"to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go."
II,I,Second Lord,"I'll attend your lordship."
II,I,Second Lord,"That such a crafty devil as is his mother"
II,I,Second Lord,"Should yield the world this ass! a woman that"

II,IV,IACHIMO,"Of her or you, having proceeded but"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"By both your wills."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If you can make't apparent"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That you have tasted her in bed, my hand"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You had of her pure honour gains or loses"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To who shall find them."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Sir, my circumstances,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Being so near the truth as I will make them,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Must first induce you to believe: whose strength"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"You need it not."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Proceed."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"First, her bedchamber,--"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"With tapesty of silk and silver; the story"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"The press of boats or pride: a piece of work"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Since the true life on't was--"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is true;"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And this you might have heard of here, by me,"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Or by some other."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"More particulars"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Must justify my knowledge."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"So they must,"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Or do your honour injury."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"The chimney"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"So likely to report themselves: the cutter"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Motion and breath left out."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is a thing"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which you might from relation likewise reap,"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Being, as it is, much spoke of."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"The roof o' the chamber"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Depending on their brands."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is her honour!"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Be given to your remembrance--the description"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of what is in her chamber nothing saves"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The wager you have laid."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Then, if you can,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"And now 'tis up again: it must be married"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"To that your diamond; I'll keep them."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Jove!"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Once more let me behold it: is it that"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which I left with her?"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Sir--I thank her--that:"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Her pretty action did outsell her gift,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"She prized it once."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"May be she pluck'd it off"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To send it me."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"She writes so to you, doth she?"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is a basilisk unto mine eye,"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Where there's another man: the vows of women"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, above measure false!"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"Have patience, sir,"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"It may be probable she lost it; or"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"Hath stol'n it from her?"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Very true;"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Render to me some corporal sign about her,"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More evident than this; for this was stolen."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"By Jupiter, I had it from her arm."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"She would not lose it: her attendants are"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The cognizance of her incontinency"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Is this: she hath bought the name of whore"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"thus dearly."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Divide themselves between you!"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"Sir, be patient:"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"This is not strong enough to be believed"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"Of one persuaded well of--"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Never talk on't;"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"She hath been colted by him."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"If you seek"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"For further satisfying, under her breast--"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"To feed again, though full. You do remember"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"This stain upon her?"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Ay, and it doth confirm"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Another stain, as big as hell can hold,"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Were there no more but it."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"Will you hear more?"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Once, and a million!"
II,IV,IACHIMO,"I'll be sworn--"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No swearing."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Thou'st made me cuckold."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"I'll deny nothing."
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I will go there and do't, i' the court, before"
II,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Her father. I'll do something--"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"Quite besides"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"The government of patience! You have won:"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath"
II,IV,PHILARIO,"He hath against himself."
II,IV,IACHIMO,"With an my heart."
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Is there no way for men to be but women"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And that most venerable man which I"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Did call my father, was I know not where"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The Dian of that time so doth my wife"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But what he look'd for should oppose and she"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Should from encounter guard. Could I find out"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The woman's part in me! For there's no motion"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That tends to vice in man, but I affirm"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Nice longing, slanders, mutability,"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For even to vice"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"They are not constant but are changing still"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"One vice, but of a minute old, for one"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"In a true hate, to pray they have their will:"
II,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The very devils cannot plague them better."
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Than in his feats deserving it--for him"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And his succession granted Rome a tribute,"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Is left untender'd."
III,I,QUEEN,"And, to kill the marvel,"
III,I,QUEEN,"Shall be so ever."
III,I,CLOTEN,"There be many Caesars,"
III,I,CLOTEN,"Ere such another Julius. Britain is"
III,I,CLOTEN,"A world by itself; and we will nothing pay"
III,I,CLOTEN,"For wearing our own noses."
III,I,QUEEN,"That opportunity"
III,I,QUEEN,"Which then they had to take from 's, to resume"
III,I,QUEEN,"We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,"
III,I,QUEEN,"The kings your ancestors, together with"
III,I,QUEEN,"The natural bravery of your isle, which stands"
III,I,QUEEN,"As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in"
III,I,QUEEN,"With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,"
III,I,QUEEN,"With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,"
III,I,QUEEN,"But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest"
III,I,QUEEN,"Caesar made here; but made not here his brag"
III,I,QUEEN,"Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--"
III,I,QUEEN,"That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried"
III,I,QUEEN,"From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--"
III,I,QUEEN,"Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,"
III,I,QUEEN,"Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd"
III,I,QUEEN,"As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof"
III,I,QUEEN,"The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--"
III,I,QUEEN,"O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,"
III,I,QUEEN,"Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright"
III,I,QUEEN,"And Britons strut with courage."
III,I,CLOTEN,"Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our"
III,I,CLOTEN,"kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,"
III,I,CLOTEN,"as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of"
III,I,CLOTEN,"them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such"
III,I,CLOTEN,"straight arms, none."
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Son, let your mother end."
III,I,CLOTEN,"We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as"
III,I,CLOTEN,"Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a"
III,I,CLOTEN,"hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If"
III,I,CLOTEN,"Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or"
III,I,CLOTEN,"put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute"
III,I,CLOTEN,"for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now."
III,I,CYMBELINE,"You must know,"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Till the injurious Romans did extort"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"This tribute from us, we were free:"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Caesar's ambition,"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"The sides o' the world, against all colour here"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Ourselves to be."
III,I,CLOTEN,"We do."
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Say, then, to Caesar,"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Who was the first of Britain which did put"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"His brows within a golden crown and call'd"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Himself a king."
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"I am sorry, Cymbeline,"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Receive it from me, then: war and confusion"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,"
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"I thank thee for myself."
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Thou art welcome, Caius."
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Which he to seek of me again, perforce,"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"Which not to read would show the Britons cold:"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"So Caesar shall not find them."
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Let proof speak."
III,I,CLOTEN,"His majesty bids you welcome. Make"
III,I,CLOTEN,"pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if"
III,I,CLOTEN,"you seek us afterwards in other terms, you"
III,I,CLOTEN,"shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you"
III,I,CLOTEN,"beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in"
III,I,CLOTEN,"the adventure, our crows shall fare the better"
III,I,CLOTEN,"for you; and there's an end."
III,I,CAIUS LUCIUS,"So, sir."
III,I,CYMBELINE,"I know your master's pleasure and he mine:"
III,I,CYMBELINE,"All the remain is 'Welcome!'"
III,II,PISANIO,"How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not"
III,II,PISANIO,"What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,"
III,II,PISANIO,"O master! what a strange infection"
III,II,PISANIO,"Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,"
III,II,PISANIO,"As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd"
III,II,PISANIO,"On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:"
III,II,PISANIO,"She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,"
III,II,PISANIO,"More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults"
III,II,PISANIO,"As would take in some virtue. O my master!"
III,II,PISANIO,"Thy mind to her is now as low as were"
III,II,PISANIO,"Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?"
III,II,PISANIO,"Upon the love and truth and vows which I"
III,II,PISANIO,"Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?"
III,II,PISANIO,"If it be so to do good service, never"
III,II,PISANIO,"Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,"
III,II,PISANIO,"That I should seem to lack humanity"
III,II,PISANIO,"so much as this fact comes to?"
III,II,PISANIO,"'Do't: the letter"
III,II,PISANIO,"that I have sent her, by her own command"
III,II,PISANIO,"Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!"
III,II,PISANIO,"Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,"
III,II,PISANIO,"Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st"
III,II,PISANIO,"So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes."
III,II,PISANIO,"I am ignorant in what I am commanded."
III,II,IMOGEN,"How now, Pisanio!"
III,II,PISANIO,"Madam, here is a letter from my lord."
III,II,IMOGEN,"Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!"
III,II,IMOGEN,"O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer"
III,II,IMOGEN,"That knew the stars as I his characters;"
III,II,IMOGEN,"He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Let what is here contain'd relish of love,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not"
III,II,IMOGEN,"That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"For it doth physic love: of his content,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be"
III,II,IMOGEN,"You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers"
III,II,IMOGEN,"And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet"
III,II,IMOGEN,"You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!"
III,II,IMOGEN,"'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me"
III,II,IMOGEN,"in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as"
III,II,IMOGEN,"you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me"
III,II,IMOGEN,"with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of"
III,II,IMOGEN,"this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all"
III,II,IMOGEN,"happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"increasing in love,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'"
III,II,IMOGEN,"O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?"
III,II,IMOGEN,"He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me"
III,II,IMOGEN,"How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs"
III,II,IMOGEN,"May plod it in a week, why may not I"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--"
III,II,IMOGEN,"let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;"
III,II,IMOGEN,"For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"To the smothering of the sense--how far it is"
III,II,IMOGEN,"To this same blessed Milford: and by the way"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Tell me how Wales was made so happy as"
III,II,IMOGEN,"To inherit such a haven: but first of all,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"How we may steal from hence, and for the gap"
III,II,IMOGEN,"That we shall make in time, from our hence-going"
III,II,IMOGEN,"And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?"
III,II,IMOGEN,"We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"How many score of miles may we well ride"
III,II,IMOGEN,"'Twixt hour and hour?"
III,II,PISANIO,"One score 'twixt sun and sun,"
III,II,PISANIO,"Madam, 's enough for you:"
III,II,PISANIO,"and too much too."
III,II,IMOGEN,"Why, one that rode to's execution, man,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Could never go so slow: I have heard of"
III,II,IMOGEN,"riding wagers,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Where horses have been nimbler than the sands"
III,II,IMOGEN,"That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say"
III,II,IMOGEN,"She'll home to her father: and provide me presently"
III,II,IMOGEN,"A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit"
III,II,IMOGEN,"A franklin's housewife."
III,II,PISANIO,"Madam, you're best consider."
III,II,IMOGEN,"I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,"
III,II,IMOGEN,"Accessible is none but Milford way."
III,III,BELARIUS,"A goodly day not to keep house, with such"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you"
III,III,BELARIUS,"To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And keep their impious turbans on, without"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!"
III,III,BELARIUS,"We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly"
III,III,BELARIUS,"As prouder livers do."
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"Hail, heaven!"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"Hail, heaven!"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"When you above perceive me like a crow,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"That it is place which lessens and sets off;"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And you may then revolve what tales I have told you"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:"
III,III,BELARIUS,"This service is not service, so being done,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Draws us a profit from all things we see;"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And often, to our comfort, shall we find"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The sharded beetle in a safer hold"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Is nobler than attending for a cheque,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours."
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,"
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not"
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"What air's from home. Haply this life is best,"
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"If quiet life be best; sweeter to you"
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"That have a sharper known; well corresponding"
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"With your stiff age: but unto us it is"
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;"
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"A prison for a debtor, that not dares"
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"To stride a limit."
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"What should we speak of"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"When we are old as you? when we shall hear"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"The rain and wind beat dark December, how,"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,"
III,III,ARVIRAGUS,"And sing our bondage freely."
III,III,BELARIUS,"How you speak!"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Did you but know the city's usuries"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court"
III,III,BELARIUS,"As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Is certain falling, or so slippery that"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"A pain that only seems to seek out danger"
III,III,BELARIUS,"I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'"
III,III,BELARIUS,"the search,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph"
III,III,BELARIUS,"As record of fair act; nay, many times,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The world may read in me: my body's mark'd"
III,III,BELARIUS,"With Roman swords, and my report was once"
III,III,BELARIUS,"First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And when a soldier was the theme, my name"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Was not far off: then was I as a tree"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"A storm or robbery, call it what you will,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And left me bare to weather."
III,III,GUIDERIUS,"Uncertain favour!"
III,III,BELARIUS,"My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--"
III,III,BELARIUS,"But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline"
III,III,BELARIUS,"I was confederate with the Romans: so"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years"
III,III,BELARIUS,"This rock and these demesnes have been my world;"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid"
III,III,BELARIUS,"More pious debts to heaven than in all"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!"
III,III,BELARIUS,"This is not hunters' language: he that strikes"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;"
III,III,BELARIUS,"To him the other two shall minister;"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And we will fear no poison, which attends"
III,III,BELARIUS,"In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys."
III,III,BELARIUS,"How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!"
III,III,BELARIUS,"These boys know little they are sons to the king;"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive."
III,III,BELARIUS,"They think they are mine; and though train'd"
III,III,BELARIUS,"up thus meanly"
III,III,BELARIUS,"I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them"
III,III,BELARIUS,"In simple and low things to prince it much"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!"
III,III,BELARIUS,"When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then"
III,III,BELARIUS,"The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture"
III,III,BELARIUS,"That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Strikes life into my speech and shows much more"
III,III,BELARIUS,"His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!"
III,III,BELARIUS,"O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"At three and two years old, I stole these babes;"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Thinking to bar thee of succession, as"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for"
III,III,BELARIUS,"their mother,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"And every day do honour to her grave:"
III,III,BELARIUS,"Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,"
III,III,BELARIUS,"They take for natural father. The game is up."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Beyond self-explication: put thyself"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"A look untender? If't be summer news,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"May take off some extremity, which to read"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Would be even mortal to me."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Please you, read;"
III,IV,PISANIO,"And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing"
III,IV,PISANIO,"The most disdain'd of fortune."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"her life: I shall give thee opportunity at"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"equally to me disloyal.'"
III,IV,PISANIO,"What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Rides on the posting winds and doth belie"
III,IV,PISANIO,"All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave"
III,IV,PISANIO,"This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"False to his bed! What is it to be false?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"To lie in watch there and to think on him?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"charge nature,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"To break it with a fearful dream of him"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Alas, good lady!"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Put on for villany; not born where't grows,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"But worn a bait for ladies."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Good madam, hear me."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"A little witness my obedience: look!"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Thy master is not there, who was indeed"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"The riches of it: do his bidding; strike"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"But now thou seem'st a coward."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Hence, vile instrument!"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Thou shalt not damn my hand."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Why, I must die;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"And if I do not by thy hand, thou art"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"There is a prohibition so divine"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Believe false teachers: though those that"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"are betray'd"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Stands in worse case of woe."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"My disobedience 'gainst the king my father"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"And make me put into contempt the suits"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"It is no act of common passage, but"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"That now thou tirest on, how thy memory"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"When I desire it too."
III,IV,PISANIO,"O gracious lady,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Since I received command to do this business"
III,IV,PISANIO,"I have not slept one wink."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Do't, and to bed then."
III,IV,PISANIO,"I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Wherefore then"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"So many miles with a pretence? this place?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"For my being absent? whereunto I never"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"The elected deer before thee?"
III,IV,PISANIO,"But to win time"
III,IV,PISANIO,"To lose so bad employment; in the which"
III,IV,PISANIO,"I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Hear me with patience."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Talk thy tongue weary; speak"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Nor tent to bottom that. But speak."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Then, madam,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"I thought you would not back again."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Most like;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Bringing me here to kill me."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Not so, neither:"
III,IV,PISANIO,"But if I were as wise as honest, then"
III,IV,PISANIO,"My purpose would prove well. It cannot be"
III,IV,PISANIO,"But that my master is abused:"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Some villain, ay, and singular in his art."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Hath done you both this cursed injury."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Some Roman courtezan."
III,IV,PISANIO,"No, on my life."
III,IV,PISANIO,"I'll give but notice you are dead and send him"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded"
III,IV,PISANIO,"I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"And that will well confirm it."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Why good fellow,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Or in my life what comfort, when I am"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Dead to my husband?"
III,IV,PISANIO,"If you'll back to the court--"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"No court, no father; nor no more ado"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"As fearful as a siege."
III,IV,PISANIO,"If not at court,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Then not in Britain must you bide."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Where then"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"There's livers out of Britain."
III,IV,PISANIO,"I am most glad"
III,IV,PISANIO,"You think of other place. The ambassador,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven"
III,IV,PISANIO,"To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise"
III,IV,PISANIO,"That which, to appear itself, must not yet be"
III,IV,PISANIO,"But by self-danger, you should tread a course"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near"
III,IV,PISANIO,"The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least"
III,IV,PISANIO,"That though his actions were not visible, yet"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Report should render him hourly to your ear"
III,IV,PISANIO,"As truly as he moves."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"O, for such means!"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"I would adventure."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Well, then, here's the point:"
III,IV,PISANIO,"You must forget to be a woman; change"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Command into obedience: fear and niceness--"
III,IV,PISANIO,"The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and"
III,IV,PISANIO,"As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Of common-kissing Titan, and forget"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein"
III,IV,PISANIO,"You made great Juno angry."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Nay, be brief"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"I see into thy end, and am almost"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"A man already."
III,IV,PISANIO,"First, make yourself but like one."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--"
III,IV,PISANIO,"'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all"
III,IV,PISANIO,"That answer to them: would you in their serving,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"And with what imitation you can borrow"
III,IV,PISANIO,"From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Present yourself, desire his service, tell him"
III,IV,PISANIO,"wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless"
III,IV,PISANIO,"With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable"
III,IV,PISANIO,"And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"You have me, rich; and I will never fail"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Beginning nor supplyment."
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Thou art all the comfort"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"All that good time will give us: this attempt"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"I am soldier to, and will abide it with"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"A prince's courage. Away, I prithee."
III,IV,PISANIO,"Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Here is a box; I had it from the queen:"
III,IV,PISANIO,"What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Will drive away distemper. To some shade,"
III,IV,PISANIO,"And fit you to your manhood. May the gods"
III,IV,PISANIO,"Direct you to the best!"
III,IV,IMOGEN,"Amen: I thank thee."
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Thus far; and so farewell."
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thanks, royal sir."
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;"
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And am right sorry that I must report ye"
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"My master's enemy."
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Our subjects, sir,"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"To show less sovereignty than they, must needs"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Appear unkinglike."
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"So, sir: I desire of you"
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven."
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Madam, all joy befal your grace!"
III,V,QUEEN,"And you!"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"My lords, you are appointed for that office;"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"The due of honour in no point omit."
III,V,CYMBELINE,"So farewell, noble Lucius."
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Your hand, my lord."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Receive it friendly; but from this time forth"
III,V,CLOTEN,"I wear it as your enemy."
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Sir, the event"
III,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Is yet to name the winner: fare you well."
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!"
III,V,QUEEN,"He goes hence frowning: but it honours us"
III,V,QUEEN,"That we have given him cause."
III,V,CLOTEN,"'Tis all the better;"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it."
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"The powers that he already hath in Gallia"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"His war for Britain."
III,V,QUEEN,"'Tis not sleepy business;"
III,V,QUEEN,"But must be look'd to speedily and strongly."
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Our expectation that it would be thus"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"The duty of the day: she looks us like"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"A thing more made of malice than of duty:"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"We have noted it. Call her before us; for"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"We have been too slight in sufferance."
III,V,QUEEN,"Royal sir,"
III,V,QUEEN,"Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired"
III,V,QUEEN,"Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,"
III,V,QUEEN,"'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,"
III,V,QUEEN,"Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady"
III,V,QUEEN,"So tender of rebukes that words are strokes"
III,V,QUEEN,"And strokes death to her."
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Where is she, sir? How"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Can her contempt be answer'd?"
III,V,Attendant,"Please you, sir,"
III,V,Attendant,"Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer"
III,V,Attendant,"That will be given to the loudest noise we make."
III,V,QUEEN,"My lord, when last I went to visit her,"
III,V,QUEEN,"She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,"
III,V,QUEEN,"Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,"
III,V,QUEEN,"She should that duty leave unpaid to you,"
III,V,QUEEN,"Which daily she was bound to proffer: this"
III,V,QUEEN,"She wish'd me to make known; but our great court"
III,V,QUEEN,"Made me to blame in memory."
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Her doors lock'd?"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear"
III,V,CYMBELINE,"Prove false!"
III,V,QUEEN,"Son, I say, follow the king."
III,V,CLOTEN,"That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"have not seen these two days."
III,V,QUEEN,"Go, look after."
III,V,QUEEN,"Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!"
III,V,QUEEN,"He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence"
III,V,QUEEN,"Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes"
III,V,QUEEN,"It is a thing most precious. But for her,"
III,V,QUEEN,"Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,"
III,V,QUEEN,"Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown"
III,V,QUEEN,"To her desired Posthumus: gone she is"
III,V,QUEEN,"To death or to dishonour; and my end"
III,V,QUEEN,"Can make good use of either: she being down,"
III,V,QUEEN,"I have the placing of the British crown."
III,V,QUEEN,"How now, my son!"
III,V,CLOTEN,"'Tis certain she is fled."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Dare come about him."
III,V,QUEEN,"This night forestall him of the coming day!"
III,V,CLOTEN,"I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one"
III,V,CLOTEN,"The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Disdaining me and throwing favours on"
III,V,CLOTEN,"The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment"
III,V,CLOTEN,"That what's else rare is choked; and in that point"
III,V,CLOTEN,"I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Where is thy lady? In a word; or else"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Thou art straightway with the fiends."
III,V,PISANIO,"O, good my lord!"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--"
III,V,CLOTEN,"I will not ask again. Close villain,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?"
III,V,CLOTEN,"From whose so many weights of baseness cannot"
III,V,CLOTEN,"A dram of worth be drawn."
III,V,PISANIO,"Alas, my lord,"
III,V,PISANIO,"How can she be with him? When was she missed?"
III,V,PISANIO,"He is in Rome."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Where is she, sir? Come nearer;"
III,V,CLOTEN,"No further halting: satisfy me home"
III,V,CLOTEN,"What is become of her."
III,V,PISANIO,"O, my all-worthy lord!"
III,V,CLOTEN,"All-worthy villain!"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Discover where thy mistress is at once,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Speak, or thy silence on the instant is"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Thy condemnation and thy death."
III,V,PISANIO,"Then, sir,"
III,V,PISANIO,"This paper is the history of my knowledge"
III,V,PISANIO,"Touching her flight."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Let's see't. I will pursue her"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Even to Augustus' throne."
III,V,PISANIO,"She's far enough; and what he learns by this"
III,V,PISANIO,"May prove his travel, not her danger."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Hum!"
III,V,PISANIO,"Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!"
III,V,CLOTEN,"Sirrah, is this letter true?"
III,V,PISANIO,"Sir, as I think."
III,V,CLOTEN,"It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou"
III,V,CLOTEN,"wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"undergo those employments wherein I should have"
III,V,CLOTEN,"cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it"
III,V,CLOTEN,"directly and truly, I would think thee an honest"
III,V,CLOTEN,"man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy"
III,V,CLOTEN,"relief nor my voice for thy preferment."
III,V,PISANIO,"Well, my good lord."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and"
III,V,CLOTEN,"constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of"
III,V,CLOTEN,"that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the"
III,V,CLOTEN,"course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of"
III,V,CLOTEN,"mine: wilt thou serve me?"
III,V,PISANIO,"Sir, I will."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy"
III,V,CLOTEN,"late master's garments in thy possession?"
III,V,PISANIO,"I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he"
III,V,PISANIO,"wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress."
III,V,CLOTEN,"The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit"
III,V,CLOTEN,"hither: let it be thy lint service; go."
III,V,PISANIO,"I shall, my lord."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one"
III,V,CLOTEN,"thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou"
III,V,CLOTEN,"villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these"
III,V,CLOTEN,"garments were come. She said upon a time--the"
III,V,CLOTEN,"bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she"
III,V,CLOTEN,"held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect"
III,V,CLOTEN,"than my noble and natural person together with the"
III,V,CLOTEN,"adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my"
III,V,CLOTEN,"back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her"
III,V,CLOTEN,"eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then"
III,V,CLOTEN,"be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my"
III,V,CLOTEN,"speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and"
III,V,CLOTEN,"when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex"
III,V,CLOTEN,"her I will execute in the clothes that she so"
III,V,CLOTEN,"praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot"
III,V,CLOTEN,"her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"and I'll be merry in my revenge."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Be those the garments?"
III,V,PISANIO,"Ay, my noble lord."
III,V,CLOTEN,"How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?"
III,V,PISANIO,"She can scarce be there yet."
III,V,CLOTEN,"Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second"
III,V,CLOTEN,"thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,"
III,V,CLOTEN,"that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be"
III,V,CLOTEN,"but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself"
III,V,CLOTEN,"to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had"
III,V,CLOTEN,"wings to follow it! Come, and be true."
III,V,PISANIO,"Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee"
III,V,PISANIO,"Were to prove false, which I will never be,"
III,V,PISANIO,"To him that is most true. To Milford go,"
III,V,PISANIO,"And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,"
III,V,PISANIO,"You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed"
III,V,PISANIO,"Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I see a man's life is a tedious one:"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I have tired myself, and for two nights together"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"But that my resolution helps me. Milford,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"My hunger's gone; but even before, I was"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"At point to sink for food. But what is this?"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I were best not to call; I dare not call:"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"yet famine,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter."
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't."
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Such a foe, good heavens!"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"The sweat of industry would dry and die,"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Will make what's homely savoury: weariness"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Poor house, that keep'st thyself!"
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"I am thoroughly weary."
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite."
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,"
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Stay; come not in."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"But that it eats our victuals, I should think"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Here were a fairy."
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"What's the matter, sir?"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"An earthly paragon! Behold divineness"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"No elder than a boy!"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Good masters, harm me not:"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"To have begg'd or bought what I have took:"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"good troth,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I would have left it on the board so soon"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"As I had made my meal, and parted"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"With prayers for the provider."
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"Money, youth?"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"Who worship dirty gods."
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I see you're angry:"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Have died had I not made it."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Whither bound?"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"To Milford-Haven."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"What's your name?"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I am fall'n in this offence."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Prithee, fair youth,"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Boys, bid him welcome."
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"Were you a woman, youth,"
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,"
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"I bid for you as I'd buy."
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"I'll make't my comfort"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"And such a welcome as I'd give to him"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends."
III,VI,IMOGEN,"'Mongst friends,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"If brothers."
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Would it had been so, that they"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Had been my father's sons! then had my prize"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Been less, and so more equal ballasting"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"To thee, Posthumus."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"He wrings at some distress."
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"Would I could free't!"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"Or I, whate'er it be,"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"What pain it cost, what danger. God's!"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Hark, boys."
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Great men,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"That had a court no bigger than this cave,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"That did attend themselves and had the virtue"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"I'd change my sex to be companion with them,"
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Since Leonatus's false."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"It shall be so."
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,"
III,VI,BELARIUS,"So far as thou wilt speak it."
III,VI,GUIDERIUS,"Pray, draw near."
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"The night to the owl and morn to the lark"
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"less welcome."
III,VI,IMOGEN,"Thanks, sir."
III,VI,ARVIRAGUS,"I pray, draw near."
III,VII,First Senator,"This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:"
III,VII,First Senator,"That since the common men are now in action"
III,VII,First Senator,"'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,"
III,VII,First Senator,"And that the legions now in Gallia are"
III,VII,First Senator,"Full weak to undertake our wars against"
III,VII,First Senator,"The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite"
III,VII,First Senator,"The gentry to this business. He creates"
III,VII,First Senator,"Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,"
III,VII,First Senator,"For this immediate levy, he commends"
III,VII,First Senator,"His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!"
III,VII,First Tribune,"Is Lucius general of the forces?"
III,VII,Second Senator,"Ay."
III,VII,First Tribune,"Remaining now in Gallia?"
III,VII,First Senator,"With those legions"
III,VII,First Senator,"Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy"
III,VII,First Senator,"Must be supplyant: the words of your commission"
III,VII,First Senator,"Will tie you to the numbers and the time"
III,VII,First Senator,"Of their dispatch."
III,VII,First Tribune,"We will discharge our duty."
IV,I,CLOTEN,"I am near to the place where they should meet, if"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"conversant in general services, and more remarkable"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"father; who may haply be a little angry for my so"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"rough usage; but my mother, having power of his"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"the very description of their meeting-place; and"
IV,I,CLOTEN,"the fellow dares not deceive me."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"We'll come to you after hunting."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Are we not brothers?"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"So man and man should be;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"But clay and clay differs in dignity,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"So sick I am not, yet I am not well;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"But not so citizen a wanton as"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Cannot amend me; society is no comfort"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"To one not sociable: I am not very sick,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Stealing so poorly."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I love thee; I have spoke it"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"How much the quantity, the weight as much,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"As I do love my father."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"What! how! how!"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"If it be sin to say so, I yoke me"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"In my good brother's fault: I know not why"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"I love this youth; and I have heard you say,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"'My father, not this youth.'"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"I'm not their father; yet who this should be,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Doth miracle itself, loved before me."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Brother, farewell."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I wish ye sport."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"You health. So please you, sir."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I have heard!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Experience, O, thou disprovest report!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I'll now taste of thy drug."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I could not stir him:"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"I might know more."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"To the field, to the field!"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"We'll not be long away."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Pray, be not sick,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"For you must be our housewife."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Well or ill,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I am bound to you."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"And shalt be ever."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Good ancestors."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"How angel-like he sings!"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"But his neat cookery! he cut our roots"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"In characters,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"And he her dieter."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Nobly he yokes"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Was that it was, for not being such a smile;"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"From so divine a temple, to commix"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"With winds that sailors rail at."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I do note"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"That grief and patience, rooted in him both,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Mingle their spurs together."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Grow, patience!"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"His perishing root with the increasing vine!"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"It is great morning. Come, away!--"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Who's there?"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"I cannot find those runagates; that villain"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Hath mock'd me. I am faint."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"'Those runagates!'"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"I saw him not these many years, and yet"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"He is but one: you and my brother search"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"What companies are near: pray you, away;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Let me alone with him."
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Soft! What are you"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"I have heard of such. What slave art thou?"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"A thing"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"More slavish did I ne'er than answering"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"A slave without a knock."
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Thou art a robber,"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Why I should yield to thee?"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Thou villain base,"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Know'st me not by my clothes?"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"No, nor thy tailor, rascal,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Which, as it seems, make thee."
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Thou precious varlet,"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"My tailor made them not."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Hence, then, and thank"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I am loath to beat thee."
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Thou injurious thief,"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Hear but my name, and tremble."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"What's thy name?"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Cloten, thou villain."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Adder, Spider,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"'Twould move me sooner."
IV,II,CLOTEN,"To thy further fear,"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"I am son to the queen."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I am sorry for 't; not seeming"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"So worthy as thy birth."
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Art not afeard?"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"At fools I laugh, not fear them."
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Die the death:"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"When I have slain thee with my proper hand,"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"I'll follow those that even now fled hence,"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:"
IV,II,CLOTEN,"Yield, rustic mountaineer."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"No companies abroad?"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"None in the world: you did mistake him, sure."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"'Twas very Cloten."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"In this place we left them:"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"I wish my brother make good time with him,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"You say he is so fell."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Being scarce made up,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"I mean, to man, he had not apprehension"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"There was no money in't: not Hercules"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"My head as I do his."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"What hast thou done?"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Son to the queen, after his own report;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"With his own single hand he'ld take us in"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"And set them on Lud's-town."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"We are all undone."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"But that he swore to take, our lives? The law"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Protects not us: then why should we be tender"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Play judge and executioner all himself,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"For we do fear the law? What company"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Discover you abroad?"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"No single soul"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"He must have some attendants. Though his humour"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Absolute madness could so far have raved"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"To bring him here alone; although perhaps"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"It may be heard at court that such as we"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"As it is like him--might break out, and swear"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"To come alone, either he so undertaking,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"If we do fear this body hath a tail"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"More perilous than the head."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Let ordinance"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"My brother hath done well."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"I had no mind"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Did make my way long forth."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"With his own sword,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"That's all I reck."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"I fear 'twill be revenged:"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Becomes thee well enough."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Would I had done't"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"I love thee brotherly, but envy much"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"That possible strength might meet, would seek us through"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"And put us to our answer."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Well, 'tis done:"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"To dinner presently."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Poor sick Fidele!"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"And praise myself for charity."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"O thou goddess,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"In these two princely boys! They are as gentle"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"As zephyrs blowing below the violet,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"That by the top doth take the mountain pine,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"That an invisible instinct should frame them"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Civility not seen from other, valour"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"What Cloten's being here to us portends,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Or what his death will bring us."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Where's my brother?"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"For his return."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"My ingenious instrument!"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Is he at home?"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"He went hence even now."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"it did not speak before. All solemn things"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Is jollity for apes and grief for boys."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Is Cadwal mad?"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Look, here he comes,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"And brings the dire occasion in his arms"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Of what we blame him for."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"The bird is dead"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"That we have made so much on. I had rather"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Than have seen this."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"O sweetest, fairest lily!"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"My brother wears thee not the one half so well"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"As when thou grew'st thyself."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"O melancholy!"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"How found you him?"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Stark, as you see:"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"right cheek"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Reposing on a cushion."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Where?"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"O' the floor;"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Answer'd my steps too loud."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Why, he but sleeps:"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"And worms will not come to thee."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"With fairest flowers"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Without a monument!--bring thee all this;"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"To winter-ground thy corse."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Prithee, have done;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"And do not play in wench-like words with that"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Which is so serious. Let us bury him,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"And not protract with admiration what"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Is now due debt. To the grave!"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Say, where shall's lay him?"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"By good Euriphile, our mother."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Be't so:"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"And let us, Polydore, though now our voices"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"As once our mother; use like note and words,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Save that Euriphile must be Fidele."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Cadwal,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Than priests and fanes that lie."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"We'll speak it, then."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"And though he came our enemy, remember"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"He was paid for that: though mean and"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"mighty, rotting"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Together, have one dust, yet reverence,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"That angel of the world, doth make distinction"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"And though you took his life, as being our foe,"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Yet bury him as a prince."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Pray You, fetch him hither."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"When neither are alive."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"If you'll go fetch him,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"My father hath a reason for't."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"'Tis true."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Come on then, and remove him."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"So. Begin."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Fear no more the heat o' the sun,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Nor the furious winter's rages;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Thou thy worldly task hast done,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Golden lads and girls all must,"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"As chimney-sweepers, come to dust."
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Fear no more the frown o' the great;"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Care no more to clothe and eat;"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"To thee the reed is as the oak:"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"The sceptre, learning, physic, must"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"All follow this, and come to dust."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Fear no more the lightning flash,"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Fear not slander, censure rash;"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"All lovers young, all lovers must"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Consign to thee, and come to dust."
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"No exorciser harm thee!"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Nor no witchcraft charm thee!"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Ghost unlaid forbear thee!"
IV,II,ARVIRAGUS,"Nothing ill come near thee!"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"Quiet consummation have;"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"And renowned be thy grave!"
IV,II,GUIDERIUS,"We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"These herblets shall, which we upon you strew."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Come on, away: apart upon our knees."
IV,II,BELARIUS,"The ground that gave them first has them again:"
IV,II,BELARIUS,"Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"the way?--"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"But, soft! no bedfellow!--O gods and goddesses!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"From this most bravest vessel of the world"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"where's that?"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"The drug he gave me, which he said was precious"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"And cordial to me, have I not found it"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"That we the horrider may seem to those"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!"
IV,II,Captain,"To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,"
IV,II,Captain,"After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending"
IV,II,Captain,"You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:"
IV,II,Captain,"They are in readiness."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"But what from Rome?"
IV,II,Captain,"The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners"
IV,II,Captain,"And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,"
IV,II,Captain,"That promise noble service: and they come"
IV,II,Captain,"Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,"
IV,II,Captain,"Syenna's brother."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"When expect you them?"
IV,II,Captain,"With the next benefit o' the wind."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"This forwardness"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?"
IV,II,Soothsayer,"Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--"
IV,II,Soothsayer,"I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:"
IV,II,Soothsayer,"I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd"
IV,II,Soothsayer,"From the spongy south to this part of the west,"
IV,II,Soothsayer,"There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--"
IV,II,Soothsayer,"Unless my sins abuse my divination--"
IV,II,Soothsayer,"Success to the Roman host."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Dream often so,"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"It was a worthy building. How! a page!"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"For nature doth abhor to make his bed"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Let's see the boy's face."
IV,II,Captain,"He's alive, my lord."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"They crave to be demanded. Who is this"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"That, otherwise than noble nature did,"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"What art thou?"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I am nothing: or if not,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Nothing to be were better. This was my master,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"A very valiant Briton and a good,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"There is no more such masters: I may wander"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"From east to occident, cry out for service,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Try many, all good, serve truly, never"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Find such another master."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"'Lack, good youth!"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thou movest no less with thy complaining than"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Richard du Champ."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"If I do lie and do"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thy name?"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Fidele, sir."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thou dost approve thyself the very same:"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me."
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"And on it said a century of prayers,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"And leaving so his service, follow you,"
IV,II,IMOGEN,"So please you entertain me."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Ay, good youth!"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And rather father thee than master thee."
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"My friends,"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And make him with our pikes and partisans"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes"
IV,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Some falls are means the happier to arise."
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her."
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"A fever with the absence of her son,"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"Upon a desperate bed, and in a time"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"So needful for this present: it strikes me, past"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"Who needs must know of her departure and"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"By a sharp torture."
IV,III,PISANIO,"Sir, my life is yours;"
IV,III,PISANIO,"I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,"
IV,III,PISANIO,"I nothing know where she remains, why gone,"
IV,III,PISANIO,"Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,"
IV,III,PISANIO,"Hold me your loyal servant."
IV,III,First Lord,"Good my liege,"
IV,III,First Lord,"The day that she was missing he was here:"
IV,III,First Lord,"I dare be bound he's true and shall perform"
IV,III,First Lord,"All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,"
IV,III,First Lord,"There wants no diligence in seeking him,"
IV,III,First Lord,"And will, no doubt, be found."
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"The time is troublesome."
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"Does yet depend."
IV,III,First Lord,"So please your majesty,"
IV,III,First Lord,"The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,"
IV,III,First Lord,"Are landed on your coast, with a supply"
IV,III,First Lord,"Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent."
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"Now for the counsel of my son and queen!"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"I am amazed with matter."
IV,III,First Lord,"Good my liege,"
IV,III,First Lord,"Your preparation can affront no less"
IV,III,First Lord,"Than what you hear of: come more, for more"
IV,III,First Lord,"you're ready:"
IV,III,First Lord,"The want is but to put those powers in motion"
IV,III,First Lord,"That long to move."
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"I thank you. Let's withdraw;"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"What can from Italy annoy us; but"
IV,III,CYMBELINE,"We grieve at chances here. Away!"
IV,III,PISANIO,"I heard no letter from my master since"
IV,III,PISANIO,"I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:"
IV,III,PISANIO,"Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise"
IV,III,PISANIO,"To yield me often tidings: neither know I"
IV,III,PISANIO,"What is betid to Cloten; but remain"
IV,III,PISANIO,"Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work."
IV,III,PISANIO,"Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true."
IV,III,PISANIO,"These present wars shall find I love my country,"
IV,III,PISANIO,"Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them."
IV,III,PISANIO,"All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:"
IV,III,PISANIO,"Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd."
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"The noise is round about us."
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Let us from it."
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"From action and adventure?"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"Nay, what hope"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"For barbarous and unnatural revolts"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"During their use, and slay us after."
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Sons,"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us."
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"To the king's party there's no going: newness"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Among the bands--may drive us to a render"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Where we have lived, and so extort from's that"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Which we have done, whose answer would be death"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Drawn on with torture."
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"This is, sir, a doubt"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"In such a time nothing becoming you,"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"Nor satisfying us."
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"It is not likely"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"That they will waste their time upon our note,"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"To know from whence we are."
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"O, I am known"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Of many in the army: many years,"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"From my remembrance. And, besides, the king"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Who find in my exile the want of breeding,"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"To have the courtesy your cradle promised,"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"But to be still hot summer's tamings and"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"The shrinking slaves of winter."
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"Than be so"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"I and my brother are not known; yourself"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"Cannot be question'd."
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"By this sun that shines,"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"I'll thither: what thing is it that I never"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"Never bestrid a horse, save one that had"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"To look upon the holy sun, to have"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"The benefit of his blest beams, remaining"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"So long a poor unknown."
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"By heavens, I'll go:"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"I'll take the better care, but if you will not,"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"The hazard therefore due fall on me by"
IV,IV,GUIDERIUS,"The hands of Romans!"
IV,IV,ARVIRAGUS,"So say I amen."
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"No reason I, since of your lives you set"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"So slight a valuation, should reserve"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"If in your country wars you chance to die,"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Lead, lead."
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"The time seems long; their blood"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"thinks scorn,"
IV,IV,BELARIUS,"Till it fly out and show them princes born."
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If each of you should take this course, how many"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Must murder wives much better than themselves"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Every good servant does not all commands:"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Had lived to put on this: so had you saved"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The noble Imogen to repent, and struck"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To have them fall no more: you some permit"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To second ills with ills, each elder worse,"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift."
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Among the Italian gentry, and to fight"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of these Italian weeds and suit myself"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Against the part I come with; so I'll die"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More valour in me than my habits show."
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin"
V,I,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The fashion, less without and more within."
V,II,IACHIMO,"The heaviness and guilt within my bosom"
V,II,IACHIMO,"Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,"
V,II,IACHIMO,"The princess of this country, and the air on't"
V,II,IACHIMO,"Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,"
V,II,IACHIMO,"A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me"
V,II,IACHIMO,"In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne"
V,II,IACHIMO,"As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn."
V,II,IACHIMO,"If that thy gentry, Britain, go before"
V,II,IACHIMO,"This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds"
V,II,IACHIMO,"Is that we scarce are men and you are gods."
V,II,BELARIUS,"Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;"
V,II,BELARIUS,"The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but"
V,II,BELARIUS,"The villany of our fears."
V,II,GUIDERIUS,"Stand, stand, and fight!"
V,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;"
V,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such"
V,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"As war were hoodwink'd."
V,II,IACHIMO,"'Tis their fresh supplies."
V,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes"
V,II,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Let's reinforce, or fly."
V,III,Lord,"Camest thou from where they made the stand?"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I did."
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Though you, it seems, come from the fliers."
V,III,Lord,"I did."
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But that the heavens fought: the king himself"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of his wings destitute, the army broken,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To die with lengthen'd shame."
V,III,Lord,"Where was this lane?"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"An honest one, I warrant; who deserved"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"So long a breeding as his white beard came to,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"He, with two striplings-lads more like to run"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The country base than to commit such slaughter"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than those for preservation cased, or shame--"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Or we are Romans and will give you that"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"These three,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Three thousand confident, in act as many--"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For three performers are the file when all"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Accommodated by the place, more charming"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"turn'd coward"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But by example--O, a sin in war,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The way that they did, and to grin like lions"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Like fragments in hard voyages, became"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Some slain before; some dying; some their friends"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Those that would die or ere resist are grown"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The mortal bugs o' the field."
V,III,Lord,"This was strange chance"
V,III,Lord,"A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys."
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Rather to wonder at the things you hear"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'"
V,III,Lord,"Nay, be not angry, sir."
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Lack, to what end?"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For if he'll do as he is made to do,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too."
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You have put me into rhyme."
V,III,Lord,"Farewell; you're angry."
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Still going?"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is a lord! O noble misery,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To-day how many would have given their honours"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Could not find death where I did hear him groan,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For being now a favourer to the Briton,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No more a Briton, I have resumed again"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The part I came in: fight I will no more,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But yield me to the veriest hind that shall"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Here made by the Roman; great the answer be"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"On either side I come to spend my breath;"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But end it by some means for Imogen."
V,III,First Captain,"Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken."
V,III,First Captain,"'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels."
V,III,Second Captain,"There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,"
V,III,Second Captain,"That gave the affront with them."
V,III,First Captain,"So 'tis reported:"
V,III,First Captain,"But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A Roman,"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds"
V,III,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Had answer'd him."
V,III,Second Captain,"Lay hands on him; a dog!"
V,III,Second Captain,"A leg of Rome shall not return to tell"
V,III,Second Captain,"What crows have peck'd them here. He brags"
V,III,Second Captain,"his service"
V,III,Second Captain,"As if he were of note: bring him to the king."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"So graze as you find pasture."
V,IV,Second Gaoler,"Ay, or a stomach."
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"think, to liberty: yet am I better"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Groan so in perpetuity than be cured"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"By the sure physician, death, who is the key"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"So children temporal fathers do appease;"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I cannot do it better than in gyves,"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No stricter render of me than my all."
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I know you are more clement than vile men,"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who of their broken debtors take a third,"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"On their abatement: that's not my desire:"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If you will take this audit, take this life,"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I'll speak to thee in silence."
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"No more, thou thunder-master, show"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Thy spite on mortal flies:"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"That thy adulteries"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Rates and revenges."
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Hath my poor boy done aught but well,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Whose face I never saw?"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"I died whilst in the womb he stay'd"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Attending nature's law:"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Whose father then, as men report"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Thou orphans' father art,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"From this earth-vexing smart."
V,IV,Mother,"Lucina lent not me her aid,"
V,IV,Mother,"But took me in my throes;"
V,IV,Mother,"That from me was Posthumus ript,"
V,IV,Mother,"Came crying 'mongst his foes,"
V,IV,Mother,"A thing of pity!"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Great nature, like his ancestry,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Moulded the stuff so fair,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"That he deserved the praise o' the world,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"As great Sicilius' heir."
V,IV,First Brother,"When once he was mature for man,"
V,IV,First Brother,"In Britain where was he"
V,IV,First Brother,"That could stand up his parallel;"
V,IV,First Brother,"Or fruitful object be"
V,IV,First Brother,"In eye of Imogen, that best"
V,IV,First Brother,"Could deem his dignity?"
V,IV,Mother,"With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,"
V,IV,Mother,"To be exiled, and thrown"
V,IV,Mother,"From Leonati seat, and cast"
V,IV,Mother,"From her his dearest one,"
V,IV,Mother,"Sweet Imogen?"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Why did you suffer Iachimo,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Slight thing of Italy,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"To taint his nobler heart and brain"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"With needless jealosy;"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"And to become the geck and scorn"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"O' th' other's villany?"
V,IV,Second Brother,"For this from stiller seats we came,"
V,IV,Second Brother,"Our parents and us twain,"
V,IV,Second Brother,"That striking in our country's cause"
V,IV,Second Brother,"Fell bravely and were slain,"
V,IV,Second Brother,"Our fealty and Tenantius' right"
V,IV,Second Brother,"With honour to maintain."
V,IV,First Brother,"Like hardiment Posthumus hath"
V,IV,First Brother,"To Cymbeline perform'd:"
V,IV,First Brother,"Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,"
V,IV,First Brother,"Why hast thou thus adjourn'd"
V,IV,First Brother,"The graces for his merits due,"
V,IV,First Brother,"Being all to dolours turn'd?"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Thy crystal window ope; look out;"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"No longer exercise"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Upon a valiant race thy harsh"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"And potent injuries."
V,IV,Mother,"Since, Jupiter, our son is good,"
V,IV,Mother,"Take off his miseries."
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Peep through thy marble mansion; help;"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Or we poor ghosts will cry"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"To the shining synod of the rest"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Against thy deity."
V,IV,First Brother,"Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,"
V,IV,First Brother,"And from thy justice fly."
V,IV,Jupiter,"No more, you petty spirits of region low,"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Be not with mortal accidents opprest;"
V,IV,Jupiter,"No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours."
V,IV,Jupiter,"Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,"
V,IV,Jupiter,"The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:"
V,IV,Jupiter,"His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent."
V,IV,Jupiter,"Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade."
V,IV,Jupiter,"He shall be lord of lady Imogen,"
V,IV,Jupiter,"And happier much by his affliction made."
V,IV,Jupiter,"This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:"
V,IV,Jupiter,"and so, away: no further with your din"
V,IV,Jupiter,"Express impatience, lest you stir up mine."
V,IV,Jupiter,"Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline."
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"He came in thunder; his celestial breath"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"As when his god is pleased."
V,IV,All,"Thanks, Jupiter!"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"His radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,"
V,IV,Sicilius Leonatus,"Let us with care perform his great behest."
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"A father to me; and thou hast created"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"On greatness' favour dream as I have done,"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"Many dream not to find, neither deserve,"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"That have this golden chance and know not why."
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"As good as promise."
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"lopped branches, which, being dead many years,"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"Or senseless speaking or a speaking such"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"The action of my life is like it, which"
V,IV,Posthumus Leonatus,"I'll keep, if but for sympathy."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"Come, sir, are you ready for death?"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Over-roasted rather; ready long ago."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"Hanging is the word, sir: if"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"you be ready for that, you are well cooked."
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"So, if I prove a good repast to the"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"spectators, the dish pays the shot."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"you shall be called to no more payments, fear no"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"both empty; the brain the heavier for being too"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"light, the purse too light, being drawn of"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"counters; so the acquittance follows."
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I am merrier to die than thou art to live."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"would change places with his officer; for, look you,"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"sir, you know not which way you shall go."
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Yes, indeed do I, fellow."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"him so pictured: you must either be directed by"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"some that take upon them to know, or do take upon"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"never return to tell one."
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and"
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"will not use them."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"What an infinite mock is this, that a man should"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"have the best use of eyes to see the way of"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking."
V,IV,Messenger,"Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king."
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"I'll be hang'd then."
V,IV,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead."
V,IV,First Gaoler,"Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"too that die against their wills; so should I, if I"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but"
V,IV,First Gaoler,"my wish hath a preferment in 't."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"That the poor soldier that so richly fought,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"He shall be happy that can find him, if"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Our grace can make him so."
V,V,BELARIUS,"I never saw"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Such noble fury in so poor a thing;"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Such precious deeds in one that promises nought"
V,V,BELARIUS,"But beggary and poor looks."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"No tidings of him?"
V,V,PISANIO,"He hath been search'd among the dead and living,"
V,V,PISANIO,"But no trace of him."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"To my grief, I am"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"The heir of his reward;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"which I will add"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"To ask of whence you are. Report it."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Sir,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Further to boast were neither true nor modest,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Unless I add, we are honest."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Bow your knees."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Companions to our person and will fit you"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"With dignities becoming your estates."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"There's business in these faces. Why so sadly"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And not o' the court of Britain."
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Hail, great king!"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"To sour your happiness, I must report"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"The queen is dead."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Who worse than a physician"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Would this report become? But I consider,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"With horror, madly dying, like her life,"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Which, being cruel to the world, concluded"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"I will report, so please you: these her women"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Were present when she finish'd."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Prithee, say."
V,V,CORNELIUS,"First, she confess'd she never loved you, only"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Affected greatness got by you, not you:"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Married your royalty, was wife to your place;"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Abhorr'd your person."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"She alone knew this;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And, but she spoke it dying, I would not"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed."
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"With such integrity, she did confess"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"But that her flight prevented it, she had"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Ta'en off by poison."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"O most delicate fiend!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Should by the minute feed on life and lingering"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"O'ercome you with her show, and in time,"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"When she had fitted you with her craft, to work"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Her son into the adoption of the crown:"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"But, failing of her end by his strange absence,"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Despairing died."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Heard you all this, her women?"
V,V,First Lady,"We did, so please your highness."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Mine eyes"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"That thought her like her seeming; it had"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"been vicious"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"The Britons have razed out, though with the loss"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"So think of your estate."
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"We should not, when the blood was cool,"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"have threaten'd"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Augustus lives to think on't: and so much"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"For my peculiar care. This one thing only"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Let him be ransom'd: never master had"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"So tender over his occasions, true,"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"With my request, which I make bold your highness"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And spare no blood beside."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"I have surely seen him:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"His favour is familiar to me. Boy,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"The noblest ta'en."
V,V,IMOGEN,"I humbly thank your highness."
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And yet I know thou wilt."
V,V,IMOGEN,"No, no: alack,"
V,V,IMOGEN,"There's other work in hand: I see a thing"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Must shuffle for itself."
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"The boy disdains me,"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys"
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"That place them on the truth of girls and boys."
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Why stands he so perplex'd?"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"What wouldst thou, boy?"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"I love thee more and more: think more and more"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?"
V,V,IMOGEN,"He is a Roman; no more kin to me"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Am something nearer."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Wherefore eyest him so?"
V,V,IMOGEN,"I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please"
V,V,IMOGEN,"To give me hearing."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Ay, with all my heart,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And lend my best attention. What's thy name?"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Fidele, sir."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Thou'rt my good youth, my page;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Is not this boy revived from death?"
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"One sand another"
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad"
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?"
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"The same dead thing alive."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure"
V,V,BELARIUS,"He would have spoke to us."
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"But we saw him dead."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Be silent; let's see further."
V,V,PISANIO,"Since she is living, let the time run on"
V,V,PISANIO,"To good or bad."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Come, stand thou by our side;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Make thy demand aloud."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Sir, step you forth;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Which is our honour, bitter torture shall"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him."
V,V,IMOGEN,"My boon is, that this gentleman may render"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Of whom he had this ring."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"That diamond upon your finger, say"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"How came it yours?"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Which, to be spoke, would torture thee."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"How! me?"
V,V,IACHIMO,"I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Which torments me to conceal. By villany"
V,V,IACHIMO,"I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may"
V,V,IACHIMO,"grieve thee,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived"
V,V,IACHIMO,"'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"All that belongs to this."
V,V,IACHIMO,"That paragon, thy daughter,--"
V,V,IACHIMO,"For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak."
V,V,IACHIMO,"Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock"
V,V,IACHIMO,"That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed"
V,V,IACHIMO,"The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Our viands had been poison'd, or at least"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--"
V,V,IACHIMO,"What should I say? he was too good to be"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Where ill men were; and was the best of all"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Hearing us praise our loves of Italy"
V,V,IACHIMO,"For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming"
V,V,IACHIMO,"The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva."
V,V,IACHIMO,"Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"A shop of all the qualities that man"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Fairness which strikes the eye--"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"I stand on fire:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Come to the matter."
V,V,IACHIMO,"All too soon I shall,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Most like a noble lord in love and one"
V,V,IACHIMO,"That had a royal lover, took his hint;"
V,V,IACHIMO,"And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein"
V,V,IACHIMO,"He was as calm as virtue--he began"
V,V,IACHIMO,"His mistress' picture; which by his tongue"
V,V,IACHIMO,"being made,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"And then a mind put in't, either our brags"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Proved us unspeaking sots."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Nay, nay, to the purpose."
V,V,IACHIMO,"Your daughter's chastity--there it begins."
V,V,IACHIMO,"He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Upon his honour'd finger, to attain"
V,V,IACHIMO,"In suit the place of's bed and win this ring"
V,V,IACHIMO,"By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"No lesser of her honour confident"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;"
V,V,IACHIMO,"And would so, had it been a carbuncle"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Post I in this design: well may you, sir,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Remember me at court; where I was taught"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Of your chaste daughter the wide difference"
V,V,IACHIMO,"'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain"
V,V,IACHIMO,"'Gan in your duller Britain operate"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:"
V,V,IACHIMO,"And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"That I return'd with simular proof enough"
V,V,IACHIMO,"To make the noble Leonatus mad,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"By wounding his belief in her renown"
V,V,IACHIMO,"With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--"
V,V,IACHIMO,"O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Of secret on her person, that he could not"
V,V,IACHIMO,"But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Methinks, I see him now--"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Egregious murderer, thief, any thing"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That's due to all the villains past, in being,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For torturers ingenious: it is I"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That caused a lesser villain than myself,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself."
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Imogen, Imogen!"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Peace, my lord; hear, hear--"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"There lie thy part."
V,V,PISANIO,"O, gentlemen, help!"
V,V,PISANIO,"Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!"
V,V,PISANIO,"You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!"
V,V,PISANIO,"Mine honour'd lady!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Does the world go round?"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"How come these staggers on me?"
V,V,PISANIO,"Wake, my mistress!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"To death with mortal joy."
V,V,PISANIO,"How fares thy mistress?"
V,V,IMOGEN,"O, get thee from my sight;"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Breathe not where princes are."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"The tune of Imogen!"
V,V,PISANIO,"Lady,"
V,V,PISANIO,"The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if"
V,V,PISANIO,"That box I gave you was not thought by me"
V,V,PISANIO,"A precious thing: I had it from the queen."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"New matter still?"
V,V,IMOGEN,"It poison'd me."
V,V,CORNELIUS,"O gods!"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"I left out one thing which the queen confess'd."
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Which I gave him for cordial, she is served"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"As I would serve a rat.'"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"What's this, Comelius?"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"The queen, sir, very oft importuned me"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"To temper poisons for her, still pretending"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"The satisfaction of her knowledge only"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Was of more danger, did compound for her"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"The present power of life, but in short time"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"All offices of nature should again"
V,V,CORNELIUS,"Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Most like I did, for I was dead."
V,V,BELARIUS,"My boys,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"There was our error."
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"This is, sure, Fidele."
V,V,IMOGEN,"Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Think that you are upon a rock; and now"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Throw me again."
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Hang there like a fruit, my soul,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Till the tree die!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"How now, my flesh, my child!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Wilt thou not speak to me?"
V,V,BELARIUS,"this youth, I blame ye not:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"You had a motive for't."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"My tears that fall"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Thy mother's dead."
V,V,IMOGEN,"I am sorry for't, my lord."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"O, she was nought; and long of her it was"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"That we meet here so strangely: but her son"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Is gone, we know not how nor where."
V,V,PISANIO,"My lord,"
V,V,PISANIO,"Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,"
V,V,PISANIO,"Upon my lady's missing, came to me"
V,V,PISANIO,"With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,"
V,V,PISANIO,"If I discover'd not which way she was gone,"
V,V,PISANIO,"It was my instant death. By accident,"
V,V,PISANIO,"had a feigned letter of my master's"
V,V,PISANIO,"Then in my pocket; which directed him"
V,V,PISANIO,"To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;"
V,V,PISANIO,"Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,"
V,V,PISANIO,"Which he enforced from me, away he posts"
V,V,PISANIO,"With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate"
V,V,PISANIO,"My lady's honour: what became of him"
V,V,PISANIO,"I further know not."
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"Let me end the story:"
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"I slew him there."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Marry, the gods forfend!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"I would not thy good deeds should from my lips"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Deny't again."
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"I have spoke it, and I did it."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"He was a prince."
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me"
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me"
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"With language that would make me spurn the sea,"
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;"
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"And am right glad he is not standing here"
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"To tell this tale of mine."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"I am sorry for thee:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Endure our law: thou'rt dead."
V,V,IMOGEN,"That headless man"
V,V,IMOGEN,"I thought had been my lord."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Bind the offender,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And take him from our presence."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Stay, sir king:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"This man is better than the man he slew,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"As well descended as thyself; and hath"
V,V,BELARIUS,"More of thee merited than a band of Clotens"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Had ever scar for."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Let his arms alone;"
V,V,BELARIUS,"They were not born for bondage."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Why, old soldier,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"By tasting of our wrath? How of descent"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"As good as we?"
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"In that he spake too far."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And thou shalt die for't."
V,V,BELARIUS,"We will die all three:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"But I will prove that two on's are as good"
V,V,BELARIUS,"As I have given out him. My sons, I must,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Though, haply, well for you."
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"Your danger's ours."
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"And our good his."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Have at it then, by leave."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Thou hadst, great king, a subject who"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Was call'd Belarius."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"What of him? he is"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"A banish'd traitor."
V,V,BELARIUS,"He it is that hath"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;"
V,V,BELARIUS,"I know not how a traitor."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Take him hence:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"The whole world shall not save him."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Not too hot:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;"
V,V,BELARIUS,"And let it be confiscate all, so soon"
V,V,BELARIUS,"As I have received it."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Nursing of my sons!"
V,V,BELARIUS,"I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"These two young gentlemen, that call me father"
V,V,BELARIUS,"And think they are my sons, are none of mine;"
V,V,BELARIUS,"They are the issue of your loins, my liege,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"And blood of your begetting."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"How! my issue!"
V,V,BELARIUS,"So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--"
V,V,BELARIUS,"For such and so they are--these twenty years"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Having received the punishment before,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Excited me to treason: their dear loss,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Here are your sons again; and I must lose"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Two of the sweet'st companions in the world."
V,V,BELARIUS,"The benediction of these covering heavens"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy"
V,V,BELARIUS,"To inlay heaven with stars."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Thou weep'st, and speak'st."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"The service that you three have done is more"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"If these be they, I know not how to wish"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"A pair of worthier sons."
V,V,BELARIUS,"Be pleased awhile."
V,V,BELARIUS,"This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd"
V,V,BELARIUS,"In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Of his queen mother, which for more probation"
V,V,BELARIUS,"I can with ease produce."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Guiderius had"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"It was a mark of wonder."
V,V,BELARIUS,"This is he;"
V,V,BELARIUS,"Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:"
V,V,BELARIUS,"It was wise nature's end in the donation,"
V,V,BELARIUS,"To be his evidence now."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"O, what, am I"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"That, after this strange starting from your orbs,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"may reign in them now! O Imogen,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Thou hast lost by this a kingdom."
V,V,IMOGEN,"No, my lord;"
V,V,IMOGEN,"I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,"
V,V,IMOGEN,"Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter"
V,V,IMOGEN,"But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,"
V,V,IMOGEN,"When I was but your sister; I you brothers,"
V,V,IMOGEN,"When ye were so indeed."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Did you e'er meet?"
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"Ay, my good lord."
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"And at first meeting loved;"
V,V,GUIDERIUS,"Continued so, until we thought he died."
V,V,CORNELIUS,"By the queen's dram she swallow'd."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"O rare instinct!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"When shall I hear all through? This fierce"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"abridgement"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Hath to it circumstantial branches, which"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And when came you to serve our Roman captive?"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"How parted with your brothers? how first met them?"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And your three motives to the battle, with"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"I know not how much more, should be demanded;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And all the other by-dependencies,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Each object with a joy: the counterchange"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And smoke the temple with our sacrifices."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever."
V,V,IMOGEN,"You are my father too, and did relieve me,"
V,V,IMOGEN,"To see this gracious season."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"All o'erjoy'd,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"For they shall taste our comfort."
V,V,IMOGEN,"My good master,"
V,V,IMOGEN,"I will yet do you service."
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Happy be you!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"He would have well becomed this place, and graced"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"The thankings of a king."
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I am, sir,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The soldier that did company these three"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Have made you finish."
V,V,IACHIMO,"But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,"
V,V,IACHIMO,"Which I so often owe: but your ring first;"
V,V,IACHIMO,"And here the bracelet of the truest princess"
V,V,IACHIMO,"That ever swore her faith."
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Kneel not to me:"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The power that I have on you is, to spare you;"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The malice towards you to forgive you: live,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And deal with others better."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Nobly doom'd!"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Pardon's the word to all."
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"You holp us, sir,"
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"As you did mean indeed to be our brother;"
V,V,ARVIRAGUS,"Joy'd are we that you are."
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This label on my bosom; whose containing"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Is so from sense in hardness, that I can"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Make no collection of it: let him show"
V,V,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"His skill in the construction."
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Philarmonus!"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Here, my good lord."
V,V,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Read, and declare the meaning."
V,V,Soothsayer,"unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a"
V,V,Soothsayer,"piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar"
V,V,Soothsayer,"shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many"
V,V,Soothsayer,"years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old"
V,V,Soothsayer,"stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end"
V,V,Soothsayer,"his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in"
V,V,Soothsayer,"peace and plenty.'"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;"
V,V,Soothsayer,"The fit and apt construction of thy name,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Being Leonatus, doth import so much."
V,V,Soothsayer,"The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'"
V,V,Soothsayer,"We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Is this most constant wife; who, even now,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Answering the letter of the oracle,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about"
V,V,Soothsayer,"With this most tender air."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"This hath some seeming."
V,V,Soothsayer,"The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"For many years thought dead, are now revived,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Promises Britain peace and plenty."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Well"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And to the Roman empire; promising"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"To pay our wonted tribute, from the which"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Have laid most heavy hand."
V,V,Soothsayer,"The fingers of the powers above do tune"
V,V,Soothsayer,"The harmony of this peace. The vision"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"From south to west on wing soaring aloft,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun"
V,V,Soothsayer,"So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"The imperial Caesar, should again unite"
V,V,Soothsayer,"His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,"
V,V,Soothsayer,"Which shines here in the west."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Laud we the gods;"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"From our blest altars. Publish we this peace"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"To all our subjects. Set we forward: let"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"A Roman and a British ensign wave"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"And in the temple of great Jupiter"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts."
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Set on there! Never was a war did cease,"
V,V,CYMBELINE,"Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace."
