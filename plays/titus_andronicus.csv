I,I,SATURNINUS,"Defend the justice of my cause with arms,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And, countrymen, my loving followers,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Plead my successive title with your swords:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I am his first-born son, that was the last"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Then let my father's honours live in me,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Nor wrong mine age with this indignity."
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Keep then this passage to the Capitol"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"And suffer not dishonour to approach"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"To justice, continence and nobility;"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"But let desert in pure election shine,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Princes, that strive by factions and by friends"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Ambitiously for rule and empery,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"A special party, have, by common voice,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"In election for the Roman empery,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"For many good and great deserts to Rome:"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"A nobler man, a braver warrior,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lives not this day within the city walls:"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"He by the senate is accit'd home"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Ten years are spent since first he undertook"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This cause of Rome and chastised with arms"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"In coffins from the field;"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Let us entreat, by honour of his name,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Whom worthily you would have now succeed."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And in the Capitol and senate's right,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Whom you pretend to honour and adore,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That you withdraw you and abate your strength;"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"In thy uprightness and integrity,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"And so I love and honour thee and thine,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"That I will here dismiss my loving friends,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"And to my fortunes and the people's favor"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I thank you all and here dismiss you all,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And to the love and favor of my country"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Commit myself, my person and the cause."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Rome, be as just and gracious unto me"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"As I am confident and kind to thee."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Open the gates, and let me in."
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor."
I,I,Captain,"Romans, make way: the good Andronicus."
I,I,Captain,"Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,"
I,I,Captain,"Successful in the battles that he fights,"
I,I,Captain,"With honour and with fortune is return'd"
I,I,Captain,"From where he circumscribed with his sword,"
I,I,Captain,"And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Returns with precious jading to the bay"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To re-salute his country with his tears,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tears of true joy for his return to Rome."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou great defender of this Capitol,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Half of the number that King Priam had,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"These that survive let Rome reward with love;"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"These that I bring unto their latest home,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"With burial amongst their ancestors:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Make way to lay them by their brethren."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O sacred receptacle of my joys,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How many sons of mine hast thou in store,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That thou wilt never render to me more!"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Before this earthy prison of their bones;"
I,I,LUCIUS,"That so the shadows be not unappeased,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I give him you, the noblest that survives,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The eldest son of this distressed queen."
I,I,TAMORA,"Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,"
I,I,TAMORA,"Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,"
I,I,TAMORA,"A mother's tears in passion for her son:"
I,I,TAMORA,"And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,"
I,I,TAMORA,"O, think my son to be as dear to me!"
I,I,TAMORA,"Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,"
I,I,TAMORA,"To beautify thy triumphs and return,"
I,I,TAMORA,"Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,"
I,I,TAMORA,"But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,"
I,I,TAMORA,"For valiant doings in their country's cause?"
I,I,TAMORA,"O, if to fight for king and commonweal"
I,I,TAMORA,"Were piety in thine, it is in these."
I,I,TAMORA,"Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:"
I,I,TAMORA,"Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?"
I,I,TAMORA,"Draw near them then in being merciful:"
I,I,TAMORA,"Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:"
I,I,TAMORA,"Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Religiously they ask a sacrifice:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To appease their groaning shadows that are gone."
I,I,LUCIUS,"Away with him! and make a fire straight;"
I,I,LUCIUS,"And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed."
I,I,TAMORA,"O cruel, irreligious piety!"
I,I,CHIRON,"Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome."
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"To tremble under Titus' threatening looks."
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"With opportunity of sharp revenge"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--"
I,I,DEMETRIUS,"To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes."
I,I,LUCIUS,"See, lord and father, how we have perform'd"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky."
I,I,LUCIUS,"Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Let it be so; and let Andronicus"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Make this his latest farewell to their souls."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!"
I,I,LAVINIA,"In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;"
I,I,LAVINIA,"My noble lord and father, live in fame!"
I,I,LAVINIA,"Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears"
I,I,LAVINIA,"I render, for my brethren's obsequies;"
I,I,LAVINIA,"And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,"
I,I,LAVINIA,"Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:"
I,I,LAVINIA,"O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,"
I,I,LAVINIA,"Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That in your country's service drew your swords:"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That hath aspired to Solon's happiness"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And triumphs over chance in honour's bed."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This palliament of white and spotless hue;"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And name thee in election for the empire,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Be candidatus then, and put it on,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And help to set a head on headless Rome."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"A better head her glorious body fits"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What should I don this robe, and trouble you?"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Be chosen with proclamations to-day,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And set abroad new business for you all?"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And led my country's strength successfully,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And buried one and twenty valiant sons,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In right and service of their noble country"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Give me a staff of honour for mine age,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But not a sceptre to control the world:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Upright he held it, lords, that held it last."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Patience, Prince Saturninus."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Romans, do me right:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good"
I,I,LUCIUS,"That noble-minded Titus means to thee!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves."
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"But honour thee, and will do till I die:"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"I will most thankful be; and thanks to men"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Of noble minds is honourable meed."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I ask your voices and your suffrages:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?"
I,I,Tribunes,"To gratify the good Andronicus,"
I,I,Tribunes,"And gratulate his safe return to Rome,"
I,I,Tribunes,"The people will accept whom he admits."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That you create your emperor's eldest son,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And ripen justice in this commonweal:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then, if you will elect by my advice,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"With voices and applause of every sort,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Patricians and plebeians, we create"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"To us in our election this day,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And, for an onset, Titus, to advance"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Thy name and honourable family,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Lavinia will I make my empress,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"King and commander of our commonweal,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Rome shall record, and when I do forget"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"The least of these unspeakable deserts,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Romans, forget your fealty to me."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"an emperor;"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To him that, for your honour and your state,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Will use you nobly and your followers."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"That I would choose, were I to choose anew."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Princely shall be thy usage every way."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Rest on my word, and let not discontent"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?"
I,I,LAVINIA,"Not I, my lord; sith true nobility"
I,I,LAVINIA,"Warrants these words in princely courtesy."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum."
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"To do myself this reason and this right."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This prince in justice seizeth but his own."
I,I,LUCIUS,"And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Surprised! by whom?"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"By him that justly may"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Bear his betroth'd from all the world away."
I,I,MUTIUS,"Brothers, help to convey her hence away,"
I,I,MUTIUS,"And with my sword I'll keep this door safe."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back."
I,I,MUTIUS,"My lord, you pass not here."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What, villain boy!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Barr'st me my way in Rome?"
I,I,MUTIUS,"Help, Lucius, help!"
I,I,LUCIUS,"My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My sons would never so dishonour me:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor."
I,I,LUCIUS,"Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"That is another's lawful promised love."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Confederates all thus to dishonour me."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"To him that flourish'd for her with his sword"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"These words are razors to my wounded heart."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And will create thee empress of Rome,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And here I swear by all the Roman gods,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Sith priest and holy water are so near"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And tapers burn so bright and every thing"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Or climb my palace, till from forth this place"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I lead espoused my bride along with me."
I,I,TAMORA,"And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,"
I,I,TAMORA,"If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,"
I,I,TAMORA,"She will a handmaid be to his desires,"
I,I,TAMORA,"A loving nurse, a mother to his youth."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"There shall we consummate our spousal rites."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I am not bid to wait upon this bride."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That hath dishonour'd all our family;"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!"
I,I,LUCIUS,"But let us give him burial, as becomes;"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Give Mutius burial with our brethren."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This monument five hundred years hath stood,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Which I have sumptuously re-edified:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Bury him where you can; he comes not here."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My lord, this is impiety in you:"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"He must be buried with his brethren."
I,I,QUINTUS,"And shall, or him we will accompany."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'And shall!' what villain was it that spake"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"that word?"
I,I,QUINTUS,"He that would vouch it in any place but here."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What, would you bury him in my despite?"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To pardon Mutius and to bury him."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My foes I do repute you every one;"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"So, trouble me no more, but get you gone."
I,I,MARTIUS,"He is not with himself; let us withdraw."
I,I,QUINTUS,"Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--"
I,I,QUINTUS,"Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That died in honour and Lavinia's cause."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Did graciously plead for his funerals:"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Be barr'd his entrance here."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Rise, Marcus, rise."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Well, bury him, and bury me the next."
I,I,LUCIUS,"There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb."
I,I,All,"He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths"
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is she not then beholding to the man"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That brought her for this high good turn so far?"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Yes, and will nobly him remunerate."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape."
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"But let the laws of Rome determine all;"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you."
I,I,BASSIANUS,"My lord, what I have done, as best I may,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Answer I must and shall do with my life."
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Only thus much I give your grace to know:"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"By all the duties that I owe to Rome,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"That in the rescue of Lavinia"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"With his own hand did slay his youngest son,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"That hath express'd himself in all his deeds"
I,I,BASSIANUS,"A father and a friend to thee and Rome."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!"
I,I,TAMORA,"My worthy lord, if ever Tamora"
I,I,TAMORA,"Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,"
I,I,TAMORA,"Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;"
I,I,TAMORA,"And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And basely put it up without revenge?"
I,I,TAMORA,"Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend"
I,I,TAMORA,"I should be author to dishonour you!"
I,I,TAMORA,"But on mine honour dare I undertake"
I,I,TAMORA,"For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;"
I,I,TAMORA,"Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:"
I,I,TAMORA,"Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;"
I,I,TAMORA,"Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,"
I,I,TAMORA,"Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart."
I,I,TAMORA,"be won at last;"
I,I,TAMORA,"Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:"
I,I,TAMORA,"You are but newly planted in your throne;"
I,I,TAMORA,"Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,"
I,I,TAMORA,"Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,"
I,I,TAMORA,"And so supplant you for ingratitude,"
I,I,TAMORA,"Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,"
I,I,TAMORA,"Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:"
I,I,TAMORA,"I'll find a day to massacre them all"
I,I,TAMORA,"And raze their faction and their family,"
I,I,TAMORA,"The cruel father and his traitorous sons,"
I,I,TAMORA,"To whom I sued for my dear son's life,"
I,I,TAMORA,"And make them know what 'tis to let a queen"
I,I,TAMORA,"Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain."
I,I,TAMORA,"Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;"
I,I,TAMORA,"Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart"
I,I,TAMORA,"That dies in tempest of thy angry frown."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"These words, these looks, infuse new life in me."
I,I,TAMORA,"Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,"
I,I,TAMORA,"A Roman now adopted happily,"
I,I,TAMORA,"And must advise the emperor for his good."
I,I,TAMORA,"This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;"
I,I,TAMORA,"And let it be mine honour, good my lord,"
I,I,TAMORA,"That I have reconciled your friends and you."
I,I,TAMORA,"For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd"
I,I,TAMORA,"My word and promise to the emperor,"
I,I,TAMORA,"That you will be more mild and tractable."
I,I,TAMORA,"And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;"
I,I,TAMORA,"By my advice, all humbled on your knees,"
I,I,TAMORA,"You shall ask pardon of his majesty."
I,I,LUCIUS,"We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"That what we did was mildly as we might,"
I,I,LUCIUS,"Tendering our sister's honour and our own."
I,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That, on mine honour, here I do protest."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Away, and talk not; trouble us no more."
I,I,TAMORA,"Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:"
I,I,TAMORA,"The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;"
I,I,TAMORA,"I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I found a friend, and sure as death I swore"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"I would not part a bachelor from the priest."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,"
I,I,SATURNINUS,"You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"This day shall be a love-day, Tamora."
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To-morrow, an it please your majesty"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To hunt the panther and the hart with me,"
I,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour."
I,I,SATURNINUS,"Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too."
II,I,AARON,"Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,"
II,I,AARON,"Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,"
II,I,AARON,"Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;"
II,I,AARON,"Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach."
II,I,AARON,"As when the golden sun salutes the morn,"
II,I,AARON,"And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,"
II,I,AARON,"Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,"
II,I,AARON,"And overlooks the highest-peering hills;"
II,I,AARON,"So Tamora:"
II,I,AARON,"Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,"
II,I,AARON,"And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown."
II,I,AARON,"Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,"
II,I,AARON,"To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,"
II,I,AARON,"And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long"
II,I,AARON,"Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains"
II,I,AARON,"And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes"
II,I,AARON,"Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus."
II,I,AARON,"Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!"
II,I,AARON,"I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,"
II,I,AARON,"To wait upon this new-made empress."
II,I,AARON,"To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,"
II,I,AARON,"This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,"
II,I,AARON,"This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,"
II,I,AARON,"And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's."
II,I,AARON,"Holloa! what storm is this?"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"And manners, to intrude where I am graced;"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be."
II,I,CHIRON,"Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;"
II,I,CHIRON,"And so in this, to bear me down with braves."
II,I,CHIRON,"'Tis not the difference of a year or two"
II,I,CHIRON,"Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:"
II,I,CHIRON,"I am as able and as fit as thou"
II,I,CHIRON,"To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;"
II,I,CHIRON,"And that my sword upon thee shall approve,"
II,I,CHIRON,"And plead my passions for Lavinia's love."
II,I,AARON,"the peace."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Till you know better how to handle it."
II,I,CHIRON,"Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,"
II,I,CHIRON,"Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?"
II,I,AARON,"So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,"
II,I,AARON,"And maintain such a quarrel openly?"
II,I,AARON,"Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:"
II,I,AARON,"I would not for a million of gold"
II,I,AARON,"The cause were known to them it most concerns;"
II,I,AARON,"Nor would your noble mother for much more"
II,I,AARON,"Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome."
II,I,AARON,"For shame, put up."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Not I, till I have sheathed"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"My rapier in his bosom and withal"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"That he hath breathed in my dishonour here."
II,I,CHIRON,"For that I am prepared and full resolved."
II,I,CHIRON,"Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,"
II,I,CHIRON,"And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!"
II,I,AARON,"Away, I say!"
II,I,AARON,"Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,"
II,I,AARON,"This petty brabble will undo us all."
II,I,AARON,"Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous"
II,I,AARON,"It is to jet upon a prince's right?"
II,I,AARON,"What, is Lavinia then become so loose,"
II,I,AARON,"Or Bassianus so degenerate,"
II,I,AARON,"That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd"
II,I,AARON,"Without controlment, justice, or revenge?"
II,I,AARON,"Young lords, beware! and should the empress know"
II,I,AARON,"This discord's ground, the music would not please."
II,I,CHIRON,"I care not, I, knew she and all the world:"
II,I,CHIRON,"I love Lavinia more than all the world."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope."
II,I,AARON,"Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome"
II,I,AARON,"How furious and impatient they be,"
II,I,AARON,"And cannot brook competitors in love?"
II,I,AARON,"I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths"
II,I,AARON,"By this device."
II,I,CHIRON,"Aaron, a thousand deaths"
II,I,CHIRON,"Would I propose to achieve her whom I love."
II,I,AARON,"To achieve her! how?"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Why makest thou it so strange?"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"She is a woman, therefore may be won;"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"What, man! more water glideth by the mill"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Than wots the miller of; and easy it is"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Then why should he despair that knows to court it"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"With words, fair looks and liberality?"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?"
II,I,AARON,"Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so"
II,I,AARON,"Would serve your turns."
II,I,CHIRON,"Ay, so the turn were served."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Aaron, thou hast hit it."
II,I,AARON,"Would you had hit it too!"
II,I,AARON,"Then should not we be tired with this ado."
II,I,AARON,"Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools"
II,I,AARON,"To square for this? would it offend you, then"
II,I,AARON,"That both should speed?"
II,I,CHIRON,"Faith, not me."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Nor me, so I were one."
II,I,AARON,"For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:"
II,I,AARON,"'Tis policy and stratagem must do"
II,I,AARON,"That you affect; and so must you resolve,"
II,I,AARON,"That what you cannot as you would achieve,"
II,I,AARON,"You must perforce accomplish as you may."
II,I,AARON,"Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste"
II,I,AARON,"Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love."
II,I,AARON,"A speedier course than lingering languishment"
II,I,AARON,"Must we pursue, and I have found the path."
II,I,AARON,"My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;"
II,I,AARON,"There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:"
II,I,AARON,"The forest walks are wide and spacious;"
II,I,AARON,"And many unfrequented plots there are"
II,I,AARON,"Fitted by kind for rape and villany:"
II,I,AARON,"Single you thither then this dainty doe,"
II,I,AARON,"And strike her home by force, if not by words:"
II,I,AARON,"This way, or not at all, stand you in hope."
II,I,AARON,"Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit"
II,I,AARON,"To villany and vengeance consecrate,"
II,I,AARON,"Will we acquaint with all that we intend;"
II,I,AARON,"And she shall file our engines with advice,"
II,I,AARON,"That will not suffer you to square yourselves,"
II,I,AARON,"But to your wishes' height advance you both."
II,I,AARON,"The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,"
II,I,AARON,"The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:"
II,I,AARON,"The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;"
II,I,AARON,"There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take"
II,I,AARON,"your turns;"
II,I,AARON,"There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,"
II,I,AARON,"And revel in Lavinia's treasury."
II,I,CHIRON,"Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream"
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits."
II,I,DEMETRIUS,"Per Styga, per manes vehor."
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Uncouple here and let us make a bay"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And wake the emperor and his lovely bride"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That all the court may echo with the noise."
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To attend the emperor's person carefully:"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I have been troubled in my sleep this night,"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But dawning day new comfort hath inspired."
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Many good morrows to your majesty;"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Madam, to you as many and as good:"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I promised your grace a hunter's peal."
II,II,SATURNINUS,"And you have rung it lustily, my lord;"
II,II,SATURNINUS,"Somewhat too early for new-married ladies."
II,II,BASSIANUS,"Lavinia, how say you?"
II,II,LAVINIA,"I say, no;"
II,II,LAVINIA,"I have been broad awake two hours and more."
II,II,SATURNINUS,"Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,"
II,II,SATURNINUS,"And to our sport."
II,II,SATURNINUS,"Madam, now shall ye see"
II,II,SATURNINUS,"Our Roman hunting."
II,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"I have dogs, my lord,"
II,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,"
II,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And climb the highest promontory top."
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And I have horse will follow where the game"
II,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain."
II,II,DEMETRIUS,"Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,"
II,II,DEMETRIUS,"But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground."
II,III,AARON,"He that had wit would think that I had none,"
II,III,AARON,"To bury so much gold under a tree,"
II,III,AARON,"And never after to inherit it."
II,III,AARON,"Let him that thinks of me so abjectly"
II,III,AARON,"Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,"
II,III,AARON,"Which, cunningly effected, will beget"
II,III,AARON,"A very excellent piece of villany:"
II,III,AARON,"And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest"
II,III,AARON,"That have their alms out of the empress' chest."
II,III,TAMORA,"My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,"
II,III,TAMORA,"When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?"
II,III,TAMORA,"The birds chant melody on every bush,"
II,III,TAMORA,"The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,"
II,III,TAMORA,"The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind"
II,III,TAMORA,"And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:"
II,III,TAMORA,"Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,"
II,III,TAMORA,"And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,"
II,III,TAMORA,"As if a double hunt were heard at once,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;"
II,III,TAMORA,"And, after conflict such as was supposed"
II,III,TAMORA,"The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,"
II,III,TAMORA,"When with a happy storm they were surprised"
II,III,TAMORA,"And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,"
II,III,TAMORA,"We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;"
II,III,TAMORA,"Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds"
II,III,TAMORA,"Be unto us as is a nurse's song"
II,III,TAMORA,"Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep."
II,III,AARON,"Madam, though Venus govern your desires,"
II,III,AARON,"Saturn is dominator over mine:"
II,III,AARON,"What signifies my deadly-standing eye,"
II,III,AARON,"My silence and my cloudy melancholy,"
II,III,AARON,"My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls"
II,III,AARON,"Even as an adder when she doth unroll"
II,III,AARON,"To do some fatal execution?"
II,III,AARON,"No, madam, these are no venereal signs:"
II,III,AARON,"Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,"
II,III,AARON,"Blood and revenge are hammering in my head."
II,III,AARON,"Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,"
II,III,AARON,"Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,"
II,III,AARON,"This is the day of doom for Bassianus:"
II,III,AARON,"His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,"
II,III,AARON,"Thy sons make pillage of her chastity"
II,III,AARON,"And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood."
II,III,AARON,"Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,"
II,III,AARON,"And give the king this fatal plotted scroll."
II,III,AARON,"Now question me no more; we are espied;"
II,III,AARON,"Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,"
II,III,AARON,"Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction."
II,III,TAMORA,"Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!"
II,III,AARON,"No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:"
II,III,AARON,"Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons"
II,III,AARON,"To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be."
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Or is it Dian, habited like her,"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Who hath abandoned her holy groves"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"To see the general hunting in this forest?"
II,III,TAMORA,"Saucy controller of our private steps!"
II,III,TAMORA,"Had I the power that some say Dian had,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Thy temples should be planted presently"
II,III,TAMORA,"With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds"
II,III,TAMORA,"Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Unmannerly intruder as thou art!"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Under your patience, gentle empress,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;"
II,III,LAVINIA,"And to be doubted that your Moor and you"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Are singled forth to try experiments:"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!"
II,III,LAVINIA,"'Tis pity they should take him for a stag."
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Doth make your honour of his body's hue,"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Spotted, detested, and abominable."
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Why are you sequester'd from all your train,"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed."
II,III,BASSIANUS,"And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,"
II,III,BASSIANUS,"If foul desire had not conducted you?"
II,III,LAVINIA,"And, being intercepted in your sport,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Great reason that my noble lord be rated"
II,III,LAVINIA,"For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;"
II,III,LAVINIA,"This valley fits the purpose passing well."
II,III,BASSIANUS,"The king my brother shall have note of this."
II,III,LAVINIA,"Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Good king, to be so mightily abused!"
II,III,TAMORA,"Why have I patience to endure all this?"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?"
II,III,TAMORA,"Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?"
II,III,TAMORA,"These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:"
II,III,TAMORA,"A barren detested vale, you see it is;"
II,III,TAMORA,"The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,"
II,III,TAMORA,"O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:"
II,III,TAMORA,"Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:"
II,III,TAMORA,"And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,"
II,III,TAMORA,"They told me, here, at dead time of the night,"
II,III,TAMORA,"A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Would make such fearful and confused cries"
II,III,TAMORA,"As any mortal body hearing it"
II,III,TAMORA,"Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly."
II,III,TAMORA,"No sooner had they told this hellish tale,"
II,III,TAMORA,"But straight they told me they would bind me here"
II,III,TAMORA,"Unto the body of a dismal yew,"
II,III,TAMORA,"And leave me to this miserable death:"
II,III,TAMORA,"And then they call'd me foul adulteress,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms"
II,III,TAMORA,"That ever ear did hear to such effect:"
II,III,TAMORA,"And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,"
II,III,TAMORA,"This vengeance on me had they executed."
II,III,TAMORA,"Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children."
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"This is a witness that I am thy son."
II,III,CHIRON,"And this for me, struck home to show my strength."
II,III,LAVINIA,"Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"For no name fits thy nature but thy own!"
II,III,TAMORA,"Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys"
II,III,TAMORA,"Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong."
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"This minion stood upon her chastity,"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"And shall she carry this unto her grave?"
II,III,CHIRON,"An if she do, I would I were an eunuch."
II,III,CHIRON,"Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,"
II,III,CHIRON,"And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust."
II,III,TAMORA,"But when ye have the honey ye desire,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting."
II,III,CHIRON,"I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure."
II,III,CHIRON,"Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy"
II,III,CHIRON,"That nice-preserved honesty of yours."
II,III,LAVINIA,"O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--"
II,III,TAMORA,"I will not hear her speak; away with her!"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word."
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"To see her tears; but be your heart to them"
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"As unrelenting flint to drops of rain."
II,III,LAVINIA,"When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?"
II,III,LAVINIA,"O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;"
II,III,LAVINIA,"The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny."
II,III,LAVINIA,"Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Do thou entreat her show a woman pity."
II,III,CHIRON,"What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?"
II,III,LAVINIA,"'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--"
II,III,LAVINIA,"The lion moved with pity did endure"
II,III,LAVINIA,"To have his princely paws pared all away:"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:"
II,III,LAVINIA,"O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!"
II,III,TAMORA,"I know not what it means; away with her!"
II,III,LAVINIA,"O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"That gave thee life, when well he might have"
II,III,LAVINIA,"slain thee,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears."
II,III,TAMORA,"Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Even for his sake am I pitiless."
II,III,TAMORA,"Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,"
II,III,TAMORA,"To save your brother from the sacrifice;"
II,III,TAMORA,"But fierce Andronicus would not relent;"
II,III,TAMORA,"Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,"
II,III,TAMORA,"The worse to her, the better loved of me."
II,III,LAVINIA,"O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"And with thine own hands kill me in this place!"
II,III,LAVINIA,"For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Poor I was slain when Bassianus died."
II,III,TAMORA,"What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go."
II,III,LAVINIA,"'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more"
II,III,LAVINIA,"That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:"
II,III,LAVINIA,"O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"And tumble me into some loathsome pit,"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Where never man's eye may behold my body:"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Do this, and be a charitable murderer."
II,III,TAMORA,"So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:"
II,III,TAMORA,"No, let them satisfy their lust on thee."
II,III,DEMETRIUS,"Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long."
II,III,LAVINIA,"No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!"
II,III,LAVINIA,"The blot and enemy to our general name!"
II,III,LAVINIA,"Confusion fall--"
II,III,CHIRON,"Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:"
II,III,CHIRON,"This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him."
II,III,TAMORA,"Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure."
II,III,TAMORA,"Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,"
II,III,TAMORA,"Till all the Andronici be made away."
II,III,TAMORA,"Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,"
II,III,TAMORA,"And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r."
II,III,AARON,"Come on, my lords, the better foot before:"
II,III,AARON,"Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit"
II,III,AARON,"Where I espied the panther fast asleep."
II,III,QUINTUS,"My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes."
II,III,MARTIUS,"And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile."
II,III,QUINTUS,"What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,"
II,III,QUINTUS,"Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,"
II,III,QUINTUS,"Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood"
II,III,QUINTUS,"As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?"
II,III,QUINTUS,"A very fatal place it seems to me."
II,III,QUINTUS,"Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?"
II,III,MARTIUS,"O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt"
II,III,MARTIUS,"That ever eye with sight made heart lament!"
II,III,AARON,"That he thereby may give a likely guess"
II,III,AARON,"How these were they that made away his brother."
II,III,MARTIUS,"Why dost not comfort me, and help me out"
II,III,MARTIUS,"From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?"
II,III,QUINTUS,"I am surprised with an uncouth fear;"
II,III,QUINTUS,"A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:"
II,III,QUINTUS,"My heart suspects more than mine eye can see."
II,III,MARTIUS,"To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"Aaron and thou look down into this den,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"And see a fearful sight of blood and death."
II,III,QUINTUS,"Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart"
II,III,QUINTUS,"Will not permit mine eyes once to behold"
II,III,QUINTUS,"The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;"
II,III,QUINTUS,"O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now"
II,III,QUINTUS,"Was I a child to fear I know not what."
II,III,MARTIUS,"Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit."
II,III,QUINTUS,"If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?"
II,III,MARTIUS,"Upon his bloody finger he doth wear"
II,III,MARTIUS,"A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"Which, like a taper in some monument,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:"
II,III,MARTIUS,"So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus"
II,III,MARTIUS,"When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood."
II,III,MARTIUS,"O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--"
II,III,MARTIUS,"If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--"
II,III,MARTIUS,"Out of this fell devouring receptacle,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth."
II,III,QUINTUS,"Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;"
II,III,QUINTUS,"Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,"
II,III,QUINTUS,"I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb"
II,III,QUINTUS,"Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave."
II,III,QUINTUS,"I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink."
II,III,MARTIUS,"Nor I no strength to climb without thy help."
II,III,QUINTUS,"Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,"
II,III,QUINTUS,"Till thou art here aloft, or I below:"
II,III,QUINTUS,"Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"And what he is that now is leap'd into it."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Say who art thou that lately didst descend"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Into this gaping hollow of the earth?"
II,III,MARTIUS,"The unhappy son of old Andronicus:"
II,III,MARTIUS,"Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,"
II,III,MARTIUS,"To find thy brother Bassianus dead."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"He and his lady both are at the lodge"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"'Tis not an hour since I left him there."
II,III,MARTIUS,"We know not where you left him all alive;"
II,III,MARTIUS,"But, out, alas! here have we found him dead."
II,III,TAMORA,"Where is my lord the king?"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief."
II,III,TAMORA,"Where is thy brother Bassianus?"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Poor Bassianus here lies murdered."
II,III,TAMORA,"Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,"
II,III,TAMORA,"The complot of this timeless tragedy;"
II,III,TAMORA,"And wonder greatly that man's face can fold"
II,III,TAMORA,"In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Among the nettles at the elder-tree"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Which overshades the mouth of that same pit"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Where we decreed to bury Bassianus."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"O Tamora! was ever heard the like?"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"This is the pit, and this the elder-tree."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"That should have murdered Bassianus here."
II,III,AARON,"My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"bloody kind,"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Have here bereft my brother of his life."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"There let them bide until we have devised"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them."
II,III,TAMORA,"What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!"
II,III,TAMORA,"How easily murder is discovered!"
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"High emperor, upon my feeble knee"
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,"
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That this fell fault of my accursed sons,"
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"If it be proved! you see it is apparent."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?"
II,III,TAMORA,"Andronicus himself did take it up."
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;"
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow"
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"They shall be ready at your highness' will"
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To answer their suspicion with their lives."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me."
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,"
II,III,SATURNINUS,"That end upon them should be executed."
II,III,TAMORA,"Andronicus, I will entreat the king;"
II,III,TAMORA,"Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough."
II,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them."
II,IV,DEMETRIUS,"So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,"
II,IV,DEMETRIUS,"Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee."
II,IV,CHIRON,"Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,"
II,IV,CHIRON,"An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe."
II,IV,DEMETRIUS,"See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl."
II,IV,CHIRON,"Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands."
II,IV,DEMETRIUS,"She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;"
II,IV,DEMETRIUS,"And so let's leave her to her silent walks."
II,IV,CHIRON,"An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself."
II,IV,DEMETRIUS,"If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord."
II,IV,MARCUS,"Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Cousin, a word; where is your husband?"
II,IV,MARCUS,"If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!"
II,IV,MARCUS,"If I do wake, some planet strike me down,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"That I may slumber in eternal sleep!"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"And might not gain so great a happiness"
II,IV,MARCUS,"As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Coming and going with thy honey breath."
II,IV,MARCUS,"But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue."
II,IV,MARCUS,"Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!"
II,IV,MARCUS,"And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Blushing to be encountered with a cloud."
II,IV,MARCUS,"Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?"
II,IV,MARCUS,"O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is."
II,IV,MARCUS,"Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:"
II,IV,MARCUS,"But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;"
II,IV,MARCUS,"A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"That could have better sew'd than Philomel."
II,IV,MARCUS,"O, had the monster seen those lily hands"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"He would not then have touch'd them for his life!"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Which that sweet tongue hath made,"
II,IV,MARCUS,"He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep"
II,IV,MARCUS,"As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet."
II,IV,MARCUS,"Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;"
II,IV,MARCUS,"For such a sight will blind a father's eye:"
II,IV,MARCUS,"One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;"
II,IV,MARCUS,"What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?"
II,IV,MARCUS,"Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee"
II,IV,MARCUS,"O, could our mourning ease thy misery!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And for these bitter tears, which now you see"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Be pitiful to my condemned sons,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For two and twenty sons I never wept,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Because they died in honour's lofty bed."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That shall distil from these two ancient urns,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Than youthful April shall with all his showers:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And let me say, that never wept before,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My tears are now prevailing orators."
III,I,LUCIUS,"O noble father, you lament in vain:"
III,I,LUCIUS,"The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;"
III,I,LUCIUS,"And you recount your sorrows to a stone."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--"
III,I,LUCIUS,"My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"They would not mark me, or if they did mark,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"They would not pity me, yet plead I must;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And bootless unto them."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Who, though they cannot answer my distress,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For that they will not intercept my tale:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"When I do weep, they humbly at my feet"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, were they but attired in grave weeds,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Rome could afford no tribune like to these."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"A stone is silent, and offendeth not,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?"
III,I,LUCIUS,"To rescue my two brothers from their death:"
III,I,LUCIUS,"For which attempt the judges have pronounced"
III,I,LUCIUS,"My everlasting doom of banishment."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O happy man! they have befriended thee."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"From these devourers to be banished!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But who comes with our brother Marcus here?"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"I bring consuming sorrow to thine age."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Will it consume me? let me see it, then."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This was thy daughter."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, Marcus, so she is."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Ay me, this object kills me!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What fool hath added water to the sea,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My grief was at the height before thou camest,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In bootless prayer have they been held up,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And they have served me to effectless use:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Now all the service I require of them"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is that the one will help to cut the other."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, that delightful engine of her thoughts"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!"
III,I,LUCIUS,"O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, thus I found her, straying in the park,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That hath received some unrecuring wound."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"It was my deer; and he that wounded her"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For now I stand as one upon a rock"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Environed with a wilderness of sea,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Expecting ever when some envious surge"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Will in his brinish bowels swallow him."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This way to death my wretched sons are gone;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here stands my other son, a banished man,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And here my brother, weeping at my woes."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"It would have madded me: what shall I do"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Now I behold thy lively body so?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy husband he is dead: and for his death"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Perchance because she knows them innocent."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Witness the sorrow that their sister makes."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"With miry slime left on them by a flood?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And in the fountain shall we gaze so long"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Pass the remainder of our hateful days?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Plot some deuce of further misery,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To make us wonder'd at in time to come."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That to her brother which I said to thee:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, what a sympathy of woe is this,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!"
III,I,AARON,"Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor"
III,I,AARON,"Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,"
III,I,AARON,"Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,"
III,I,AARON,"Or any one of you, chop off your hand,"
III,I,AARON,"And send it to the king: he for the same"
III,I,AARON,"Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;"
III,I,AARON,"And that shall be the ransom for their fault."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Did ever raven sing so like a lark,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?"
III,I,LUCIUS,"Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"That hath thrown down so many enemies,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:"
III,I,LUCIUS,"My youth can better spare my blood than you;"
III,I,LUCIUS,"And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, none of both but are of high desert:"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My hand hath been but idle; let it serve"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To ransom my two nephews from their death;"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Then have I kept it to a worthy end."
III,I,AARON,"Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,"
III,I,AARON,"For fear they die before their pardon come."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My hand shall go."
III,I,LUCIUS,"By heaven, it shall not go!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"Let me redeem my brothers both from death."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And, for our father's sake and mother's care,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Now let me show a brother's love to thee."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Agree between you; I will spare my hand."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Then I'll go fetch an axe."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"But I will use the axe."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine."
III,I,AARON,"And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:"
III,I,AARON,"But I'll deceive you in another sort,"
III,I,AARON,"And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tell him it was a hand that warded him"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"From thousand dangers; bid him bury it"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"More hath it merited; that let it have."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As for my sons, say I account of them"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As jewels purchased at an easy price;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And yet dear too, because I bought mine own."
III,I,AARON,"I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand"
III,I,AARON,"Look by and by to have thy sons with thee."
III,I,AARON,"Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany"
III,I,AARON,"Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!"
III,I,AARON,"Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace."
III,I,AARON,"Aaron will have his soul black like his face."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"If any power pities wretched tears,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To that I call!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What, wilt thou kneel with me?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"When they do hug him in their melting bosoms."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O brother, speak with possibilities,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And do not break into these deep extremes."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then be my passions bottomless with them."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"But yet let reason govern thy lament."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"If there were reason for these miseries,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then into limits could I bind my woes:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then must my earth with her continual tears"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But like a drunkard must I vomit them."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then give me leave, for losers will have leave"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues."
III,I,Messenger,"Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid"
III,I,Messenger,"For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor."
III,I,Messenger,"Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;"
III,I,Messenger,"And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;"
III,I,Messenger,"Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd;"
III,I,Messenger,"That woe is me to think upon thy woes"
III,I,Messenger,"More than remembrance of my father's death."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And be my heart an ever-burning hell!"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"These miseries are more than may be borne."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"But sorrow flouted at is double death."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"And yet detested life not shrink thereat!"
III,I,LUCIUS,"That ever death should let life bear his name,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"As frozen water to a starved snake."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"When will this fearful slumber have an end?"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Even like a stony image, cold and numb."
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"The closing up of our most wretched eyes;"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ha, ha, ha!"
III,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, I have not another tear to shed:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And would usurp upon my watery eyes"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And make them blind with tributary tears:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For these two heads do seem to speak to me,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And threat me I shall never come to bliss"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Till all these mischiefs be return'd again"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Even in their throats that have committed them."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, let me see what task I have to do."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"You heavy people, circle me about,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That I may turn me to each one of you,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And in this hand the other I will bear."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth."
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, if you love me, as I think you do,"
III,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:"
III,I,LUCIUS,"Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:"
III,I,LUCIUS,"Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;"
III,I,LUCIUS,"O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!"
III,I,LUCIUS,"But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives"
III,I,LUCIUS,"But in oblivion and hateful griefs."
III,I,LUCIUS,"If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;"
III,I,LUCIUS,"And make proud Saturnine and his empress"
III,I,LUCIUS,"Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen."
III,I,LUCIUS,"Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,"
III,I,LUCIUS,"To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Than will preserve just so much strength in us"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As will revenge these bitter woes of ours."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And cannot passionate our tenfold grief"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then thus I thump it down."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or get some little knife between thy teeth,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And just against thy heart make thou a hole;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"May run into that sink, and soaking in"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears."
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay"
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Such violent hands upon her tender life."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What violent hands can she lay on her life?"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lest we remember still that we have none."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As if we should forget we had no hands,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"If Marcus did not name the word of hands!"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"She says she drinks no other drink but tears,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In thy dumb action will I be as perfect"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As begging hermits in their holy prayers:"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But I of these will wrest an alphabet"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And by still practise learn to know thy meaning."
III,II,Young LUCIUS,"Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:"
III,II,Young LUCIUS,"Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale."
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,"
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And tears will quickly melt thy life away."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?"
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"A deed of death done on the innocent"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I see thou art not for my company."
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But how, if that fly had a father and mother?"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How would he hang his slender gilded wings,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And buzz lamenting doings in the air!"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Poor harmless fly,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That, with his pretty buzzing melody,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Came here to make us merry! and thou hast"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"kill'd him."
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,"
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, O, O,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then pardon me for reprehending thee,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For thou hast done a charitable deed."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come hither purposely to poison me.--"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, sirrah!"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But that between us we can kill a fly"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor."
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,"
III,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"He takes false shadows for true substances."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sad stories chanced in the times of old."
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,"
III,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle."
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Follows me every where, I know not why:"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes."
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm."
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Ay, when my father was in Rome she did."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Somewhither would she have thee go with her."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Read to her sons than she hath read to thee"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Extremity of griefs would make men mad;"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"And I have read that Hecuba of Troy"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"I will most willingly attend your ladyship."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lucius, I will."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Some book there is that she desires to see."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, and take choice of all my library,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"I think she means that there was more than one"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"My mother gave it me."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"For love of her that's gone,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This is the tragic tale of Philomel,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, had we never, never hunted there!--"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"By nature made for murders and for rapes."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, why should nature build so foul a den,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Unless the gods delight in tragedies?"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"but friends,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Inspire me, that I may this treason find!"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This after me, when I have writ my name"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Without the help of any hand at all."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"What God will have discover'd for revenge;"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That we may know the traitors and the truth!"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Magni Dominator poli,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"There is enough written upon this earth"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And arm the minds of infants to exclaims."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And swear with me, as, with the woful fere"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That we will prosecute by good advice"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And see their blood, or die with this reproach."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Tis sure enough, an you knew how."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"She's with the lion deeply still in league,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And when he sleeps will she do what she list."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And with a gad of steel will write these words,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And lay it by: the angry northern wind"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"I say, my lord, that if I were a man,"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"For his ungrateful country done the like."
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"And, uncle, so will I, an if I live."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, go with me into mine armoury;"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Presents that I intend to send them both:"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?"
IV,I,Young LUCIUS,"Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course."
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:"
IV,I,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And not relent, or not compassion him?"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;"
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"But yet so just that he will not revenge."
IV,I,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!"
IV,II,CHIRON,"Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;"
IV,II,CHIRON,"He hath some message to deliver us."
IV,II,AARON,"Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather."
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"My lords, with all the humbleness I may,"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"I greet your honours from Andronicus."
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"And pray the Roman gods confound you both!"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"The goodliest weapons of his armoury"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"To gratify your honourable youth,"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"And so I do, and with his gifts present"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"You may be armed and appointed well:"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"And so I leave you both:"
IV,II,Young LUCIUS,"like bloody villains."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"What's here? A scroll; and written round about?"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Let's see;"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'"
IV,II,CHIRON,"O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:"
IV,II,CHIRON,"I read it in the grammar long ago."
IV,II,AARON,"Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it."
IV,II,AARON,"Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!"
IV,II,AARON,"Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;"
IV,II,AARON,"And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,"
IV,II,AARON,"That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick."
IV,II,AARON,"But were our witty empress well afoot,"
IV,II,AARON,"She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:"
IV,II,AARON,"But let her rest in her unrest awhile."
IV,II,AARON,"And now, young lords, was't not a happy star"
IV,II,AARON,"Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,"
IV,II,AARON,"Captives, to be advanced to this height?"
IV,II,AARON,"It did me good, before the palace gate"
IV,II,AARON,"To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"But me more good, to see so great a lord"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Basely insinuate and send us gifts."
IV,II,AARON,"Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?"
IV,II,AARON,"Did you not use his daughter very friendly?"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"I would we had a thousand Roman dames"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust."
IV,II,CHIRON,"A charitable wish and full of love."
IV,II,AARON,"Here lacks but your mother for to say amen."
IV,II,CHIRON,"And that would she for twenty thousand more."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"For our beloved mother in her pains."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?"
IV,II,CHIRON,"Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Soft! who comes here?"
IV,II,Nurse,"Good morrow, lords:"
IV,II,Nurse,"O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?"
IV,II,AARON,"Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,"
IV,II,AARON,"Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?"
IV,II,Nurse,"O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!"
IV,II,Nurse,"Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!"
IV,II,AARON,"Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!"
IV,II,AARON,"What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?"
IV,II,Nurse,"O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,"
IV,II,Nurse,"Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!"
IV,II,Nurse,"She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd."
IV,II,AARON,"To whom?"
IV,II,Nurse,"I mean, she is brought a-bed."
IV,II,AARON,"Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?"
IV,II,Nurse,"A devil."
IV,II,AARON,"Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue."
IV,II,Nurse,"A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:"
IV,II,Nurse,"Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad"
IV,II,Nurse,"Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:"
IV,II,Nurse,"The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,"
IV,II,Nurse,"And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point."
IV,II,AARON,"'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?"
IV,II,AARON,"Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Villain, what hast thou done?"
IV,II,AARON,"That which thou canst not undo."
IV,II,CHIRON,"Thou hast undone our mother."
IV,II,AARON,"Villain, I have done thy mother."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!"
IV,II,CHIRON,"It shall not live."
IV,II,AARON,"It shall not die."
IV,II,Nurse,"Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so."
IV,II,AARON,"What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I"
IV,II,AARON,"Do execution on my flesh and blood."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it."
IV,II,AARON,"Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up."
IV,II,AARON,"Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?"
IV,II,AARON,"Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,"
IV,II,AARON,"That shone so brightly when this boy was got,"
IV,II,AARON,"He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point"
IV,II,AARON,"That touches this my first-born son and heir!"
IV,II,AARON,"I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,"
IV,II,AARON,"With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,"
IV,II,AARON,"Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,"
IV,II,AARON,"Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands."
IV,II,AARON,"What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!"
IV,II,AARON,"Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!"
IV,II,AARON,"Coal-black is better than another hue,"
IV,II,AARON,"In that it scorns to bear another hue;"
IV,II,AARON,"For all the water in the ocean"
IV,II,AARON,"Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,"
IV,II,AARON,"Although she lave them hourly in the flood."
IV,II,AARON,"Tell the empress from me, I am of age"
IV,II,AARON,"To keep mine own, excuse it how she can."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?"
IV,II,AARON,"My mistress is my mistress; this myself,"
IV,II,AARON,"The vigour and the picture of my youth:"
IV,II,AARON,"This before all the world do I prefer;"
IV,II,AARON,"This maugre all the world will I keep safe,"
IV,II,AARON,"Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"By this our mother is forever shamed."
IV,II,CHIRON,"Rome will despise her for this foul escape."
IV,II,Nurse,"The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death."
IV,II,CHIRON,"I blush to think upon this ignomy."
IV,II,AARON,"Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:"
IV,II,AARON,"Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing"
IV,II,AARON,"The close enacts and counsels of the heart!"
IV,II,AARON,"Here's a young lad framed of another leer:"
IV,II,AARON,"Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,"
IV,II,AARON,"As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'"
IV,II,AARON,"He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed"
IV,II,AARON,"Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,"
IV,II,AARON,"And from that womb where you imprison'd were"
IV,II,AARON,"He is enfranchised and come to light:"
IV,II,AARON,"Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,"
IV,II,AARON,"Although my seal be stamped in his face."
IV,II,Nurse,"Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"And we will all subscribe to thy advice:"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Save thou the child, so we may all be safe."
IV,II,AARON,"Then sit we down, and let us all consult."
IV,II,AARON,"My son and I will have the wind of you:"
IV,II,AARON,"Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"How many women saw this child of his?"
IV,II,AARON,"Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,"
IV,II,AARON,"I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,"
IV,II,AARON,"The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,"
IV,II,AARON,"The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms."
IV,II,AARON,"But say, again; how many saw the child?"
IV,II,Nurse,"Cornelia the midwife and myself;"
IV,II,Nurse,"And no one else but the deliver'd empress."
IV,II,AARON,"The empress, the midwife, and yourself:"
IV,II,AARON,"Two may keep counsel when the third's away:"
IV,II,AARON,"Go to the empress, tell her this I said."
IV,II,AARON,"Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?"
IV,II,AARON,"O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:"
IV,II,AARON,"Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,"
IV,II,AARON,"A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:"
IV,II,AARON,"And now be it known to you my full intent."
IV,II,AARON,"Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;"
IV,II,AARON,"His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;"
IV,II,AARON,"His child is like to her, fair as you are:"
IV,II,AARON,"Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,"
IV,II,AARON,"And tell them both the circumstance of all;"
IV,II,AARON,"And how by this their child shall be advanced,"
IV,II,AARON,"And be received for the emperor's heir,"
IV,II,AARON,"And substituted in the place of mine,"
IV,II,AARON,"To calm this tempest whirling in the court;"
IV,II,AARON,"And let the emperor dandle him for his own."
IV,II,AARON,"Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,"
IV,II,AARON,"And you must needs bestow her funeral;"
IV,II,AARON,"The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:"
IV,II,AARON,"This done, see that you take no longer days,"
IV,II,AARON,"But send the midwife presently to me."
IV,II,AARON,"The midwife and the nurse well made away,"
IV,II,AARON,"Then let the ladies tattle what they please."
IV,II,CHIRON,"Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air"
IV,II,CHIRON,"With secrets."
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"For this care of Tamora,"
IV,II,DEMETRIUS,"Herself and hers are highly bound to thee."
IV,II,AARON,"Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;"
IV,II,AARON,"There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,"
IV,II,AARON,"And secretly to greet the empress' friends."
IV,II,AARON,"Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;"
IV,II,AARON,"For it is you that puts us to our shifts:"
IV,II,AARON,"I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,"
IV,II,AARON,"And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,"
IV,II,AARON,"And cabin in a cave, and bring you up"
IV,II,AARON,"To be a warrior, and command a camp."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sir boy, now let me see your archery;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Terras Astraea reliquit:"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Happily you may catch her in the sea;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Yet there's as little justice as at land:"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then, when you come to Pluto's region,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I pray you, deliver him this petition;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And that it comes from old Andronicus,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What time I threw the people's suffrages"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice."
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O Publius, is not this a heavy case,"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To see thy noble uncle thus distract?"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"By day and night to attend him carefully,"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"And feed his humour kindly as we may,"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"Till time beget some careful remedy."
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy."
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Publius, how now! how now, my masters!"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What, have you met with her?"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,"
IV,III,PUBLIUS,"So that perforce you must needs stay a time."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"He doth me wrong to feed me with delays."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I'll dive into the burning lake below,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And pull her out of Acheron by the heels."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"We will solicit heaven and move the gods"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"You were as good to shoot against the wind."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Of my word, I have written to effect;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"There's not a god left unsolicited."
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"We will afflict the emperor in his pride."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Now, masters, draw."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, well said, Lucius!"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas."
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Your letter is with Jupiter by this."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ha, ha!"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns."
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And who should find them but the empress' villain?"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"But give them to his master for a present."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?"
IV,III,Clown,"O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken"
IV,III,Clown,"them down again, for the man must not be hanged till"
IV,III,Clown,"the next week."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?"
IV,III,Clown,"Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him"
IV,III,Clown,"in all my life."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?"
IV,III,Clown,"Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, didst thou not come from heaven?"
IV,III,Clown,"From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there     God"
IV,III,Clown,"forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my"
IV,III,Clown,"young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the"
IV,III,Clown,"tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl"
IV,III,Clown,"betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men."
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to"
IV,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"the emperor from you."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"with a grace?"
IV,III,Clown,"Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But give your pigeons to the emperor:"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"By me thou shalt have justice at his hands."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"deliver a supplication?"
IV,III,Clown,"Ay, sir."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then here is a supplication for you. And when you"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"you do it bravely."
IV,III,Clown,"I warrant you, sir, let me alone."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And when thou hast given it the emperor,"
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Knock at my door, and tell me what he says."
IV,III,Clown,"God be with you, sir; I will."
IV,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"An emperor in Rome thus overborne,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Of egal justice, used in such contempt?"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"However these disturbers of our peace"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"But even with law, against the willful sons"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Of old Andronicus. And what an if"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"And now he writes to heaven for his redress:"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"This to Apollo; this to the god of war;"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"What's this but libelling against the senate,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"And blazoning our injustice every where?"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"As who would say, in Rome no justice were."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"But if I live, his feigned ecstasies"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Shall be no shelter to these outrages:"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"But he and his shall know that justice lives"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"He'll so awake as she in fury shall"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"And rather comfort his distressed plight"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Than prosecute the meanest or the best"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"For these contempts."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Why, thus it shall become"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?"
IV,IV,Clown,"Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor."
IV,IV,Clown,"'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:"
IV,IV,Clown,"I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Go, take him away, and hang him presently."
IV,IV,Clown,"How much money must I have?"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Come, sirrah, you must be hanged."
IV,IV,Clown,"Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to"
IV,IV,Clown,"a fair end."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Shall I endure this monstrous villany?"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"I know from whence this same device proceeds:"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"That died by law for murder of our brother,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"In hope thyself should govern Rome and me."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"What news with thee, AEmilius?"
IV,IV,AEMILIUS,"Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause."
IV,IV,AEMILIUS,"The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power"
IV,IV,AEMILIUS,"high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,"
IV,IV,AEMILIUS,"They hither march amain, under conduct"
IV,IV,AEMILIUS,"Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;"
IV,IV,AEMILIUS,"Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do"
IV,IV,AEMILIUS,"As much as ever Coriolanus did."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"These tidings nip me, and I hang the head"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"'Tis he the common people love so much;"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Myself hath often over-heard them say,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"When I have walked like a private man,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Why should you fear? is not your city strong?"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"And will revolt from me to succor him."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"The eagle suffers little birds to sing,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"And is not careful what they mean thereby,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Knowing that with the shadow of his wings"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"He can at pleasure stint their melody:"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"I will enchant the old Andronicus"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"When as the one is wounded with the bait,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"The other rotted with delicious feed."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"But he will not entreat his son for us."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"If Tamora entreat him, then he will:"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"For I can smooth and fill his aged ear"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"With golden promises; that, were his heart"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Go thou before, be our ambassador:"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Say that the emperor requests a parley"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"AEmilius, do this message honourably:"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"And if he stand on hostage for his safety,"
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Bid him demand what pledge will please him best."
IV,IV,AEMILIUS,"Your bidding shall I do effectually."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"Now will I to that old Andronicus;"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"And temper him with all the art I have,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths."
IV,IV,TAMORA,"And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,"
IV,IV,TAMORA,"And bury all thy fear in my devices."
IV,IV,SATURNINUS,"Then go successantly, and plead to him."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,"
V,I,LUCIUS,"I have received letters from great Rome,"
V,I,LUCIUS,"Which signify what hate they bear their emperor"
V,I,LUCIUS,"And how desirous of our sight they are."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,"
V,I,LUCIUS,"Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,"
V,I,LUCIUS,"And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,"
V,I,LUCIUS,"Let him make treble satisfaction."
V,I,First Goth,"Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,"
V,I,First Goth,"Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;"
V,I,First Goth,"Whose high exploits and honourable deeds"
V,I,First Goth,"Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,"
V,I,First Goth,"Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,"
V,I,First Goth,"Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day"
V,I,First Goth,"Led by their master to the flowered fields,"
V,I,First Goth,"And be avenged on cursed Tamora."
V,I,All the Goths,"And as he saith, so say we all with him."
V,I,LUCIUS,"I humbly thank him, and I thank you all."
V,I,LUCIUS,"But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?"
V,I,Second Goth,"Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd"
V,I,Second Goth,"To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;"
V,I,Second Goth,"And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye"
V,I,Second Goth,"Upon the wasted building, suddenly"
V,I,Second Goth,"I heard a child cry underneath a wall."
V,I,Second Goth,"I made unto the noise; when soon I heard"
V,I,Second Goth,"The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:"
V,I,Second Goth,"'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!"
V,I,Second Goth,"Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,"
V,I,Second Goth,"Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,"
V,I,Second Goth,"Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:"
V,I,Second Goth,"But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,"
V,I,Second Goth,"They never do beget a coal-black calf."
V,I,Second Goth,"Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates"
V,I,Second Goth,"the babe,--"
V,I,Second Goth,"'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;"
V,I,Second Goth,"Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,"
V,I,Second Goth,"Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'"
V,I,Second Goth,"With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,"
V,I,Second Goth,"Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,"
V,I,Second Goth,"To use as you think needful of the man."
V,I,LUCIUS,"O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil"
V,I,LUCIUS,"That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;"
V,I,LUCIUS,"This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,"
V,I,LUCIUS,"And here's the base fruit of his burning lust."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey"
V,I,LUCIUS,"This growing image of thy fiend-like face?"
V,I,LUCIUS,"Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?"
V,I,LUCIUS,"A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree."
V,I,LUCIUS,"And by his side his fruit of bastardy."
V,I,AARON,"Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Too like the sire for ever being good."
V,I,LUCIUS,"First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;"
V,I,LUCIUS,"A sight to vex the father's soul withal."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Get me a ladder."
V,I,AARON,"Lucius, save the child,"
V,I,AARON,"And bear it from me to the empress."
V,I,AARON,"If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,"
V,I,AARON,"That highly may advantage thee to hear:"
V,I,AARON,"If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,"
V,I,AARON,"I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'"
V,I,LUCIUS,"Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st"
V,I,LUCIUS,"Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd."
V,I,AARON,"An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,"
V,I,AARON,"'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;"
V,I,AARON,"For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,"
V,I,AARON,"Acts of black night, abominable deeds,"
V,I,AARON,"Complots of mischief, treason, villanies"
V,I,AARON,"Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:"
V,I,AARON,"And this shall all be buried by my death,"
V,I,AARON,"Unless thou swear to me my child shall live."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live."
V,I,AARON,"Swear that he shall, and then I will begin."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:"
V,I,LUCIUS,"That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?"
V,I,AARON,"What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;"
V,I,AARON,"Yet, for I know thou art religious"
V,I,AARON,"And hast a thing within thee called conscience,"
V,I,AARON,"With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,"
V,I,AARON,"Which I have seen thee careful to observe,"
V,I,AARON,"Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know"
V,I,AARON,"An idiot holds his bauble for a god"
V,I,AARON,"And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,"
V,I,AARON,"To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow"
V,I,AARON,"By that same god, what god soe'er it be,"
V,I,AARON,"That thou adorest and hast in reverence,"
V,I,AARON,"To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;"
V,I,AARON,"Or else I will discover nought to thee."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Even by my god I swear to thee I will."
V,I,AARON,"First know thou, I begot him on the empress."
V,I,LUCIUS,"O most insatiate and luxurious woman!"
V,I,AARON,"Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity"
V,I,AARON,"To that which thou shalt hear of me anon."
V,I,AARON,"'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;"
V,I,AARON,"They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her"
V,I,AARON,"And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st."
V,I,LUCIUS,"O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?"
V,I,AARON,"Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas"
V,I,AARON,"Trim sport for them that had the doing of it."
V,I,LUCIUS,"O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!"
V,I,AARON,"Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:"
V,I,AARON,"That codding spirit had they from their mother,"
V,I,AARON,"As sure a card as ever won the set;"
V,I,AARON,"That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,"
V,I,AARON,"As true a dog as ever fought at head."
V,I,AARON,"Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth."
V,I,AARON,"I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole"
V,I,AARON,"Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:"
V,I,AARON,"I wrote the letter that thy father found"
V,I,AARON,"And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,"
V,I,AARON,"Confederate with the queen and her two sons:"
V,I,AARON,"And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,"
V,I,AARON,"Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?"
V,I,AARON,"I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,"
V,I,AARON,"And, when I had it, drew myself apart"
V,I,AARON,"And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:"
V,I,AARON,"I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall"
V,I,AARON,"When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;"
V,I,AARON,"Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,"
V,I,AARON,"That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :"
V,I,AARON,"And when I told the empress of this sport,"
V,I,AARON,"She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,"
V,I,AARON,"And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses."
V,I,First Goth,"What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?"
V,I,AARON,"Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?"
V,I,AARON,"Ay, that I had not done a thousand more."
V,I,AARON,"Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,"
V,I,AARON,"Few come within the compass of my curse,--"
V,I,AARON,"Wherein I did not some notorious ill,"
V,I,AARON,"As kill a man, or else devise his death,"
V,I,AARON,"Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,"
V,I,AARON,"Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,"
V,I,AARON,"Set deadly enmity between two friends,"
V,I,AARON,"Make poor men's cattle break their necks;"
V,I,AARON,"Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,"
V,I,AARON,"And bid the owners quench them with their tears."
V,I,AARON,"Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,"
V,I,AARON,"And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,"
V,I,AARON,"Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;"
V,I,AARON,"And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,"
V,I,AARON,"Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,"
V,I,AARON,"'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'"
V,I,AARON,"Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things"
V,I,AARON,"As willingly as one would kill a fly,"
V,I,AARON,"And nothing grieves me heartily indeed"
V,I,AARON,"But that I cannot do ten thousand more."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Bring down the devil; for he must not die"
V,I,LUCIUS,"So sweet a death as hanging presently."
V,I,AARON,"If there be devils, would I were a devil,"
V,I,AARON,"To live and burn in everlasting fire,"
V,I,AARON,"So I might have your company in hell,"
V,I,AARON,"But to torment you with my bitter tongue!"
V,I,LUCIUS,"Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more."
V,I,Third Goth,"My lord, there is a messenger from Rome"
V,I,Third Goth,"Desires to be admitted to your presence."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Let him come near."
V,I,LUCIUS,"Welcome, AEmilius what's the news from Rome?"
V,I,AEMILIUS,"Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,"
V,I,AEMILIUS,"The Roman emperor greets you all by me;"
V,I,AEMILIUS,"And, for he understands you are in arms,"
V,I,AEMILIUS,"He craves a parley at your father's house,"
V,I,AEMILIUS,"Willing you to demand your hostages,"
V,I,AEMILIUS,"And they shall be immediately deliver'd."
V,I,First Goth,"What says our general?"
V,I,LUCIUS,"AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges"
V,I,LUCIUS,"Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,"
V,I,LUCIUS,"And we will come. March away."
V,II,TAMORA,"Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,"
V,II,TAMORA,"I will encounter with Andronicus,"
V,II,TAMORA,"And say I am Revenge, sent from below"
V,II,TAMORA,"To join with him and right his heinous wrongs."
V,II,TAMORA,"Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,"
V,II,TAMORA,"To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;"
V,II,TAMORA,"Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,"
V,II,TAMORA,"And work confusion on his enemies."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Who doth molest my contemplation?"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is it your trick to make me ope the door,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That so my sad decrees may fly away,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And all my study be to no effect?"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"You are deceived: for what I mean to do"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"See here in bloody lines I have set down;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And what is written shall be executed."
V,II,TAMORA,"Titus, I am come to talk with thee."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Wanting a hand to give it action?"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more."
V,II,TAMORA,"If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I am not mad; I know thee well enough:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Witness these trenches made by grief and care,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Witness the tiring day and heavy night;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is not thy coming for my other hand?"
V,II,TAMORA,"Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;"
V,II,TAMORA,"She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:"
V,II,TAMORA,"I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,"
V,II,TAMORA,"To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,"
V,II,TAMORA,"By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes."
V,II,TAMORA,"Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;"
V,II,TAMORA,"Confer with me of murder and of death:"
V,II,TAMORA,"There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,"
V,II,TAMORA,"No vast obscurity or misty vale,"
V,II,TAMORA,"Where bloody murder or detested rape"
V,II,TAMORA,"Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;"
V,II,TAMORA,"And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,"
V,II,TAMORA,"Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To be a torment to mine enemies?"
V,II,TAMORA,"I am; therefore come down, and welcome me."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Do me some service, ere I come to thee."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And whirl along with thee about the globe."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And find out murderers in their guilty caves:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And when thy car is loaden with their heads,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Even from Hyperion's rising in the east"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Until his very downfall in the sea:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And day by day I'll do this heavy task,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there."
V,II,TAMORA,"These are my ministers, and come with me."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?"
V,II,TAMORA,"Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,"
V,II,TAMORA,"Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And you, the empress! but we worldly men"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I will embrace thee in it by and by."
V,II,TAMORA,"This closing with him fits his lunacy"
V,II,TAMORA,"Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,"
V,II,TAMORA,"Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,"
V,II,TAMORA,"For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;"
V,II,TAMORA,"And, being credulous in this mad thought,"
V,II,TAMORA,"I'll make him send for Lucius his son;"
V,II,TAMORA,"And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,"
V,II,TAMORA,"I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,"
V,II,TAMORA,"To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,"
V,II,TAMORA,"Or, at the least, make them his enemies."
V,II,TAMORA,"See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How like the empress and her sons you are!"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Could not all hell afford you such a devil?"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For well I wot the empress never wags"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But in her company there is a Moor;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, would you represent our queen aright,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"It were convenient you had such a devil:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?"
V,II,TAMORA,"What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?"
V,II,DEMETRIUS,"Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him."
V,II,CHIRON,"Show me a villain that hath done a rape,"
V,II,CHIRON,"And I am sent to be revenged on him."
V,II,TAMORA,"Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,"
V,II,TAMORA,"And I will be revenged on them all."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To find another that is like to thee,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"There is a queen, attended by a Moor;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"for up and down she doth resemble thee:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I pray thee, do on them some violent death;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"They have been violent to me and mine."
V,II,TAMORA,"Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do."
V,II,TAMORA,"But would it please thee, good Andronicus,"
V,II,TAMORA,"To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,"
V,II,TAMORA,"Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,"
V,II,TAMORA,"And bid him come and banquet at thy house;"
V,II,TAMORA,"When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,"
V,II,TAMORA,"I will bring in the empress and her sons,"
V,II,TAMORA,"The emperor himself and all thy foes;"
V,II,TAMORA,"And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,"
V,II,TAMORA,"And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart."
V,II,TAMORA,"What says Andronicus to this device?"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Bid him repair to me, and bring with him"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tell him the emperor and the empress too"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This do thou for my love; and so let him,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As he regards his aged father's life."
V,II,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This will I do, and soon return again."
V,II,TAMORA,"Now will I hence about thy business,"
V,II,TAMORA,"And take my ministers along with me."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or else I'll call my brother back again,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And cleave to no revenge but Lucius."
V,II,TAMORA,"bide with him,"
V,II,TAMORA,"Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor"
V,II,TAMORA,"How I have govern'd our determined jest?"
V,II,TAMORA,"Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,"
V,II,TAMORA,"And tarry with him till I turn again."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And will o'erreach them in their own devices:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!"
V,II,DEMETRIUS,"Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here."
V,II,TAMORA,"Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes"
V,II,TAMORA,"To lay a complot to betray thy foes."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell."
V,II,CHIRON,"Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Tut, I have work enough for you to do."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!"
V,II,PUBLIUS,"What is your will?"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Know you these two?"
V,II,PUBLIUS,"The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And therefore bind them, gentle Publius."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry."
V,II,CHIRON,"Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons."
V,II,PUBLIUS,"And therefore do we what we are commanded."
V,II,PUBLIUS,"Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word."
V,II,PUBLIUS,"Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But let them hear what fearful words I utter."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This goodly summer with your winter mix'd."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My hand cut off and made a merry jest;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What would you say, if I should let you speak?"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The basin that receives your guilty blood."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"You know your mother means to feast with me,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And of the paste a coffin I will rear"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And make two pasties of your shameful heads,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Like to the earth swallow her own increase."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This is the feast that I have bid her to,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And worse than Progne I will be revenged:"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Let me go grind their bones to powder small"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And with this hateful liquor temper it;"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And in that paste let their vile heads be baked."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, come, be every one officious"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To make this banquet; which I wish may prove"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast."
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,"
V,II,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes."
V,III,LUCIUS,"Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind"
V,III,LUCIUS,"That I repair to Rome, I am content."
V,III,First Goth,"And ours with thine, befall what fortune will."
V,III,LUCIUS,"Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Till he be brought unto the empress' face,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"For testimony of her foul proceedings:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"And see the ambush of our friends be strong;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"I fear the emperor means no good to us."
V,III,AARON,"Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,"
V,III,AARON,"And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth"
V,III,AARON,"The venomous malice of my swelling heart!"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in."
V,III,LUCIUS,"The trumpets show the emperor is at hand."
V,III,SATURNINUS,"What, hath the firmament more suns than one?"
V,III,LUCIUS,"What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"These quarrels must be quietly debated."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"The feast is ready, which the careful Titus"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places."
V,III,SATURNINUS,"Marcus, we will."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it."
V,III,SATURNINUS,"Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Because I would be sure to have all well,"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To entertain your highness and your empress."
V,III,TAMORA,"We are beholding to you, good Andronicus."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"An if your highness knew my heart, you were."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My lord the emperor, resolve me this:"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Was it well done of rash Virginius"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To slay his daughter with his own right hand,"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?"
V,III,SATURNINUS,"It was, Andronicus."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Your reason, mighty lord?"
V,III,SATURNINUS,"Because the girl should not survive her shame,"
V,III,SATURNINUS,"And by her presence still renew his sorrows."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For me, most wretched, to perform the like."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!"
V,III,SATURNINUS,"What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I am as woful as Virginius was,"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And have a thousand times more cause than he"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To do this outrage: and it now is done."
V,III,SATURNINUS,"What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Will't please you eat? will't please your"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"highness feed?"
V,III,TAMORA,"Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong."
V,III,SATURNINUS,"Go fetch them hither to us presently."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,"
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred."
V,III,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point."
V,III,SATURNINUS,"Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?"
V,III,LUCIUS,"There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, let me teach you how to knit again"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"These broken limbs again into one body;"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Do shameful execution on herself."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Grave witnesses of true experience,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Cannot induce you to attend my words,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"When with his solemn tongue he did discourse"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"The story of that baleful burning night"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Or who hath brought the fatal engine in"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"But floods of tears will drown my oratory,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And break my utterance, even in the time"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"When it should move you to attend me most,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lending your kind commiseration."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak."
V,III,LUCIUS,"Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"That cursed Chiron and Demetrius"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"And they it were that ravished our sister:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"And sent her enemies unto the grave."
V,III,LUCIUS,"Lastly, myself unkindly banished,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"To beg relief among Rome's enemies:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears."
V,III,LUCIUS,"And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend."
V,III,LUCIUS,"I am the turned forth, be it known to you,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"That have preserved her welfare in my blood;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"And from her bosom took the enemy's point,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body."
V,III,LUCIUS,"Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"My scars can witness, dumb although they are,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"That my report is just and full of truth."
V,III,LUCIUS,"But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"For when no friends are by, men praise themselves."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Of this was Tamora delivered;"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"The issue of an irreligious Moor,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Chief architect and plotter of these woes:"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"The villain is alive in Titus' house,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And as he is, to witness this is true."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Or more than any living man could bear."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And, from the place where you behold us now,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"The poor remainder of Andronici"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And make a mutual closure of our house."
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall."
V,III,AEMILIUS,"Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,"
V,III,AEMILIUS,"And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,"
V,III,AEMILIUS,"Lucius our emperor; for well I know"
V,III,AEMILIUS,"The common voice do cry it shall be so."
V,III,All,"Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"As punishment for his most wicked life."
V,III,All,"Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!"
V,III,LUCIUS,"But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"For nature puts me to a heavy task:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk."
V,III,LUCIUS,"O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"The last true duties of thy noble son!"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O were the sum of these that I should pay"
V,III,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us"
V,III,LUCIUS,"To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Many a time he danced thee on his knee,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Many a matter hath he told to thee,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"In that respect, then, like a loving child,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Because kind nature doth require it so:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Do him that kindness, and take leave of him."
V,III,Young LUCIUS,"O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart"
V,III,Young LUCIUS,"Would I were dead, so you did live again!"
V,III,Young LUCIUS,"O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;"
V,III,Young LUCIUS,"My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth."
V,III,AEMILIUS,"You sad Andronici, have done with woes:"
V,III,AEMILIUS,"Give sentence on this execrable wretch,"
V,III,AEMILIUS,"That hath been breeder of these dire events."
V,III,LUCIUS,"Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"If any one relieves or pities him,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"For the offence he dies. This is our doom:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth."
V,III,AARON,"O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?"
V,III,AARON,"I am no baby, I, that with base prayers"
V,III,AARON,"I should repent the evils I have done:"
V,III,AARON,"Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did"
V,III,AARON,"Would I perform, if I might have my will;"
V,III,AARON,"If one good deed in all my life I did,"
V,III,AARON,"I do repent it from my very soul."
V,III,LUCIUS,"Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"And give him burial in his father's grave:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"My father and Lavinia shall forthwith"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Be closed in our household's monument."
V,III,LUCIUS,"As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"No mournful bell shall ring her burial;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;"
V,III,LUCIUS,"And, being so, shall have like want of pity."
V,III,LUCIUS,"See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:"
V,III,LUCIUS,"Then, afterwards, to order well the state,"
V,III,LUCIUS,"That like events may ne'er it ruinate."
