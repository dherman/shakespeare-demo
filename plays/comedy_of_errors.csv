I,I,AEGEON,"Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall"
I,I,AEGEON,"And by the doom of death end woes and all."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"I am not partial to infringe our laws:"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"The enmity and discord which of late"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Excludes all pity from our threatening looks."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"For, since the mortal and intestine jars"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"It hath in solemn synods been decreed"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"If any born at Ephesus be seen"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"At any Syracusian marts and fairs;"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Again: if any Syracusian born"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Unless a thousand marks be levied,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"To quit the penalty and to ransom him."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Therefore by law thou art condemned to die."
I,I,AEGEON,"Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,"
I,I,AEGEON,"My woes end likewise with the evening sun."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Why thou departed'st from thy native home"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus."
I,I,AEGEON,"A heavier task could not have been imposed"
I,I,AEGEON,"Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:"
I,I,AEGEON,"Yet, that the world may witness that my end"
I,I,AEGEON,"Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,"
I,I,AEGEON,"I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave."
I,I,AEGEON,"In Syracusa was I born, and wed"
I,I,AEGEON,"Unto a woman, happy but for me,"
I,I,AEGEON,"And by me, had not our hap been bad."
I,I,AEGEON,"With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased"
I,I,AEGEON,"By prosperous voyages I often made"
I,I,AEGEON,"To Epidamnum; till my factor's death"
I,I,AEGEON,"And the great care of goods at random left"
I,I,AEGEON,"Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:"
I,I,AEGEON,"From whom my absence was not six months old"
I,I,AEGEON,"Before herself, almost at fainting under"
I,I,AEGEON,"The pleasing punishment that women bear,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Had made provision for her following me"
I,I,AEGEON,"And soon and safe arrived where I was."
I,I,AEGEON,"There had she not been long, but she became"
I,I,AEGEON,"A joyful mother of two goodly sons;"
I,I,AEGEON,"And, which was strange, the one so like the other,"
I,I,AEGEON,"As could not be distinguish'd but by names."
I,I,AEGEON,"That very hour, and in the self-same inn,"
I,I,AEGEON,"A meaner woman was delivered"
I,I,AEGEON,"Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:"
I,I,AEGEON,"Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--"
I,I,AEGEON,"I bought and brought up to attend my sons."
I,I,AEGEON,"My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Made daily motions for our home return:"
I,I,AEGEON,"Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,"
I,I,AEGEON,"We came aboard."
I,I,AEGEON,"A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Before the always wind-obeying deep"
I,I,AEGEON,"Gave any tragic instance of our harm:"
I,I,AEGEON,"But longer did we not retain much hope;"
I,I,AEGEON,"For what obscured light the heavens did grant"
I,I,AEGEON,"Did but convey unto our fearful minds"
I,I,AEGEON,"A doubtful warrant of immediate death;"
I,I,AEGEON,"Which though myself would gladly have embraced,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Weeping before for what she saw must come,"
I,I,AEGEON,"And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,"
I,I,AEGEON,"That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Forced me to seek delays for them and me."
I,I,AEGEON,"And this it was, for other means was none:"
I,I,AEGEON,"The sailors sought for safety by our boat,"
I,I,AEGEON,"And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:"
I,I,AEGEON,"My wife, more careful for the latter-born,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Such as seafaring men provide for storms;"
I,I,AEGEON,"To him one of the other twins was bound,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:"
I,I,AEGEON,"The children thus disposed, my wife and I,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;"
I,I,AEGEON,"And floating straight, obedient to the stream,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought."
I,I,AEGEON,"At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Dispersed those vapours that offended us;"
I,I,AEGEON,"And by the benefit of his wished light,"
I,I,AEGEON,"The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered"
I,I,AEGEON,"Two ships from far making amain to us,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:"
I,I,AEGEON,"But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!"
I,I,AEGEON,"Gather the sequel by that went before."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"For we may pity, though not pardon thee."
I,I,AEGEON,"O, had the gods done so, I had not now"
I,I,AEGEON,"Worthily term'd them merciless to us!"
I,I,AEGEON,"For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,"
I,I,AEGEON,"We were encounterd by a mighty rock;"
I,I,AEGEON,"Which being violently borne upon,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;"
I,I,AEGEON,"So that, in this unjust divorce of us,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Fortune had left to both of us alike"
I,I,AEGEON,"What to delight in, what to sorrow for."
I,I,AEGEON,"Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened"
I,I,AEGEON,"With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Was carried with more speed before the wind;"
I,I,AEGEON,"And in our sight they three were taken up"
I,I,AEGEON,"By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought."
I,I,AEGEON,"At length, another ship had seized on us;"
I,I,AEGEON,"And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;"
I,I,AEGEON,"And would have reft the fishers of their prey,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Had not their bark been very slow of sail;"
I,I,AEGEON,"And therefore homeward did they bend their course."
I,I,AEGEON,"Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;"
I,I,AEGEON,"That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,"
I,I,AEGEON,"To tell sad stories of my own mishaps."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Do me the favour to dilate at full"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"What hath befall'n of them and thee till now."
I,I,AEGEON,"My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,"
I,I,AEGEON,"At eighteen years became inquisitive"
I,I,AEGEON,"After his brother: and importuned me"
I,I,AEGEON,"That his attendant--so his case was like,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--"
I,I,AEGEON,"Might bear him company in the quest of him:"
I,I,AEGEON,"Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,"
I,I,AEGEON,"I hazarded the loss of whom I loved."
I,I,AEGEON,"Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,"
I,I,AEGEON,"And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;"
I,I,AEGEON,"Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought"
I,I,AEGEON,"Or that or any place that harbours men."
I,I,AEGEON,"But here must end the story of my life;"
I,I,AEGEON,"And happy were I in my timely death,"
I,I,AEGEON,"Could all my travels warrant me they live."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"To bear the extremity of dire mishap!"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Which princes, would they, may not disannul,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"My soul would sue as advocate for thee."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"But, though thou art adjudged to the death"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And passed sentence may not be recall'd"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"But to our honour's great disparagement,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Yet I will favour thee in what I can."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"To seek thy life by beneficial help:"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,"
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die."
I,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Gaoler, take him to thy custody."
I,I,Gaoler,"I will, my lord."
I,I,AEGEON,"Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,"
I,I,AEGEON,"But to procrastinate his lifeless end."
I,II,First Merchant,"Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,"
I,II,First Merchant,"Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate."
I,II,First Merchant,"This very day a Syracusian merchant"
I,II,First Merchant,"Is apprehended for arrival here;"
I,II,First Merchant,"And not being able to buy out his life"
I,II,First Merchant,"According to the statute of the town,"
I,II,First Merchant,"Dies ere the weary sun set in the west."
I,II,First Merchant,"There is your money that I had to keep."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Within this hour it will be dinner-time:"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And then return and sleep within mine inn,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"For with long travel I am stiff and weary."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Get thee away."
I,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Many a man would take you at your word,"
I,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"And go indeed, having so good a mean."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"When I am dull with care and melancholy,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Lightens my humour with his merry jests."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What, will you walk with me about the town,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And then go to my inn and dine with me?"
I,II,First Merchant,"I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,"
I,II,First Merchant,"Of whom I hope to make much benefit;"
I,II,First Merchant,"I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,"
I,II,First Merchant,"Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart"
I,II,First Merchant,"And afterward consort you till bed-time:"
I,II,First Merchant,"My present business calls me from you now."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Farewell till then: I will go lose myself"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And wander up and down to view the city."
I,II,First Merchant,"Sir, I commend you to your own content."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"He that commends me to mine own content"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Commends me to the thing I cannot get."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I to the world am like a drop of water"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"That in the ocean seeks another drop,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"So I, to find a mother and a brother,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Here comes the almanac of my true date."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"My mistress made it one upon my cheek:"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"She is so hot because the meat is cold;"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"The meat is cold because you come not home;"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You come not home because you have no stomach;"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You have no stomach having broke your fast;"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Are penitent for your default to-day."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where have you left the money that I gave you?"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I am not in a sportive humour now:"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"We being strangers here, how darest thou trust"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"So great a charge from thine own custody?"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I from my mistress come to you in post;"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If I return, I shall be post indeed,"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For she will score your fault upon my pate."
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And strike you home without a messenger."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Reserve them till a merrier hour than this."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge."
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"My charge was but to fetch you from the mart"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"My mistress and her sister stays for you."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I have some marks of yours upon my pate,"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But not a thousand marks between you both."
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If I should pay your worship those again,"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Perchance you will not bear them patiently."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And prays that you will hie you home to dinner."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave."
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!"
I,II,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Upon my life, by some device or other"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"The villain is o'er-raught of all my money."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"They say this town is full of cozenage,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Soul-killing witches that deform the body,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And many such-like liberties of sin:"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner."
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:"
I,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I greatly fear my money is not safe."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"That in such haste I sent to seek his master!"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,"
II,I,LUCIANA,"And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Good sister, let us dine and never fret:"
II,I,LUCIANA,"A man is master of his liberty:"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Time is their master, and, when they see time,"
II,I,LUCIANA,"They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Why should their liberty than ours be more?"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Because their business still lies out o' door."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill."
II,I,LUCIANA,"O, know he is the bridle of your will."
II,I,ADRIANA,"There's none but asses will be bridled so."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe."
II,I,LUCIANA,"There's nothing situate under heaven's eye"
II,I,LUCIANA,"But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:"
II,I,LUCIANA,"The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Are their males' subjects and at their controls:"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Men, more divine, the masters of all these,"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Indued with intellectual sense and souls,"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Are masters to their females, and their lords:"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Then let your will attend on their accords."
II,I,ADRIANA,"This servitude makes you to keep unwed."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed."
II,I,ADRIANA,"But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey."
II,I,ADRIANA,"How if your husband start some other where?"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Till he come home again, I would forbear."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;"
II,I,ADRIANA,"They can be meek that have no other cause."
II,I,ADRIANA,"A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;"
II,I,ADRIANA,"But were we burdened with like weight of pain,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"As much or more would we ourselves complain:"
II,I,ADRIANA,"So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"But, if thou live to see like right bereft,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Well, I will marry one day, but to try."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Say, is your tardy master now at hand?"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"can witness."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"understand them."
II,I,ADRIANA,"But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he"
II,I,ADRIANA,"hath great care to please his wife."
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Horn-mad, thou villain!"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I mean not cuckold-mad;"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But, sure, he is stark mad."
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"When I desired him to come home to dinner,"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he."
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'"
II,I,LUCIANA,"Quoth who?"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Quoth my master:"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"So that my errand, due unto my tongue,"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For, in conclusion, he did beat me there."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home."
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Go back again, and be new beaten home?"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For God's sake, send some other messenger."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across."
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And he will bless that cross with other beating:"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Between you I shall have a holy head."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home."
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Am I so round with you as you with me,"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"That like a football you do spurn me thus?"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:"
II,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If I last in this service, you must case me in leather."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!"
II,I,ADRIANA,"His company must do his minions grace,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Whilst I at home starve for a merry look."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Hath homely age the alluring beauty took"
II,I,ADRIANA,"From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?"
II,I,ADRIANA,"If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Do their gay vestments his affections bait?"
II,I,ADRIANA,"That's not my fault: he's master of my state:"
II,I,ADRIANA,"What ruins are in me that can be found,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Of my defeatures. My decayed fair"
II,I,ADRIANA,"A sunny look of his would soon repair"
II,I,ADRIANA,"But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale"
II,I,ADRIANA,"And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale."
II,I,LUCIANA,"Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense."
II,I,ADRIANA,"I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Or else what lets it but he would be here?"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Sister, you know he promised me a chain;"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Would that alone, alone he would detain,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!"
II,I,ADRIANA,"I see the jewel best enamelled"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"That others touch, and often touching will"
II,I,ADRIANA,"Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"By falsehood and corruption doth it shame."
II,I,ADRIANA,"Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,"
II,I,ADRIANA,"I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die."
II,I,LUCIANA,"How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"By computation and mine host's report."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I could not speak with Dromio since at first"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"As you love strokes, so jest with me again."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"You know no Centaur? you received no gold?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"That thus so madly thou didst answer me?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Even now, even here, not half an hour since."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I did not see you since you sent me hence,"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I am glad to see you in this merry vein:"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Upon what bargain do you give it me?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Because that I familiarly sometimes"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Do use you for my fool and chat with you,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Your sauciness will jest upon my love"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And make a common of my serious hours."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"But creep in crannies when he hides his beams."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"If you will jest with me, know my aspect,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And fashion your demeanor to my looks,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Or I will beat this method in your sconce."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"had rather have it a head: an you use these blows"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Dost thou not know?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Shall I tell you why?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"a wherefore."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"For urging it the second time to me."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"nor reason?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Well, sir, I thank you."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thank me, sir, for what?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"In good time, sir; what's that?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Basting."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Well, sir, then 'twill be dry."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Your reason?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"dry basting."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"time for all things."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"By what rule, sir?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"pate of father Time himself."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Let's hear it."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"There's no time for a man to recover his hair that"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"grows bald by nature."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"May he not do it by fine and recovery?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"lost hair of another man."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"so plentiful an excrement?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"it in a kind of jollity."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"For what reason?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"For two; and sound ones too."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Nay, not sound, I pray you."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Sure ones, then."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Certain ones then."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Name them."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The one, to save the money that he spends in"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"drop in his porridge."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"You would all this time have proved there is no"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"time for all things."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"lost by nature."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"But your reason was not substantial, why there is no"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"time to recover."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"to the world's end will have bald followers."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"But, soft! who wafts us yonder?"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;"
II,II,ADRIANA,"I am not Adriana nor thy wife."
II,II,ADRIANA,"The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow"
II,II,ADRIANA,"That never words were music to thine ear,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"That never object pleasing in thine eye,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"That never touch well welcome to thy hand,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee."
II,II,ADRIANA,"How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"That thou art thus estranged from thyself?"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Thyself I call it, being strange to me,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"That, undividable, incorporate,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Am better than thy dear self's better part."
II,II,ADRIANA,"Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!"
II,II,ADRIANA,"For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall"
II,II,ADRIANA,"A drop of water in the breaking gulf,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"And take unmingled that same drop again,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Without addition or diminishing,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"As take from me thyself and not me too."
II,II,ADRIANA,"How dearly would it touch me to the quick,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious"
II,II,ADRIANA,"And that this body, consecrate to thee,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"By ruffian lust should be contaminate!"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me"
II,II,ADRIANA,"And hurl the name of husband in my face"
II,II,ADRIANA,"And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow"
II,II,ADRIANA,"And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring"
II,II,ADRIANA,"And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?"
II,II,ADRIANA,"I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it."
II,II,ADRIANA,"I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;"
II,II,ADRIANA,"My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:"
II,II,ADRIANA,"For if we too be one and thou play false,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"I do digest the poison of thy flesh,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Being strumpeted by thy contagion."
II,II,ADRIANA,"Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;"
II,II,ADRIANA,"I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"In Ephesus I am but two hours old,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"As strange unto your town as to your talk;"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Want wit in all one word to understand."
II,II,LUCIANA,"Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!"
II,II,LUCIANA,"When were you wont to use my sister thus?"
II,II,LUCIANA,"She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"By Dromio?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"By me?"
II,II,ADRIANA,"By thee; and this thou didst return from him,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Denied my house for his, me for his wife."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What is the course and drift of your compact?"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I, sir? I never saw her till this time."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Villain, thou liest; for even her very words"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Didst thou deliver to me on the mart."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I never spake with her in all my life."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"How can she thus then call us by our names,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Unless it be by inspiration."
II,II,ADRIANA,"How ill agrees it with your gravity"
II,II,ADRIANA,"To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt."
II,II,ADRIANA,"Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Makes me with thy strength to communicate:"
II,II,ADRIANA,"If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What, was I married to her in my dream?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Until I know this sure uncertainty,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy."
II,II,LUCIANA,"Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"If we obey them not, this will ensue,"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue."
II,II,LUCIANA,"Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?"
II,II,LUCIANA,"Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I am transformed, master, am I not?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I think thou art in mind, and so am I."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thou hast thine own form."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No, I am an ape."
II,II,LUCIANA,"If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be"
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"But I should know her as well as she knows me."
II,II,ADRIANA,"Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"To put the finger in the eye and weep,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn."
II,II,ADRIANA,"Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate."
II,II,ADRIANA,"Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day"
II,II,ADRIANA,"And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks."
II,II,ADRIANA,"Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter."
II,II,ADRIANA,"Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well."
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Known unto these, and to myself disguised!"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I'll say as they say and persever so,"
II,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And in this mist at all adventures go."
II,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, shall I be porter at the gate?"
II,II,ADRIANA,"Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate."
II,II,LUCIANA,"Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late."
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;"
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:"
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"Say that I linger'd with you at your shop"
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"To see the making of her carcanet,"
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"And that to-morrow you will bring it home."
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"But here's a villain that would face me down"
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,"
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,"
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"And that I did deny my wife and house."
III,I,OF EPHESUS,"Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Your own handwriting would tell you what I think."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I think thou art an ass."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Marry, so it doth appear"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"May answer my good will and your good welcome here."
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"welcome dear."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish."
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words."
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!"
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"idiot, patch!"
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch."
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st"
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"for such store,"
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"What patch is made our porter? My master stays in"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"the street."
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"catch cold on's feet."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Who talks within there? ho, open the door!"
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"me wherefore."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day."
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"when you may."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?"
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"is Dromio."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"name for an ass."
III,I,LUCE,"at the gate?"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Let my master in, Luce."
III,I,LUCE,"And so tell your master."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"O Lord, I must laugh!"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?"
III,I,LUCE,"can you tell?"
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"answered him well."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Thou baggage, let me in."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Master, knock the door hard."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down."
III,I,ADRIANA,"this noise?"
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"unruly boys."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Are you there, wife? you might have come before."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore."
III,I,ANGELO,"Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would"
III,I,ANGELO,"fain have either."
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"In debating which was best, we shall part with neither."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You would say so, master, if your garments were thin."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate."
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"knave's pate."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind."
III,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"thee, hind!"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"let me in."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow."
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;"
III,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow."
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Herein you war against your reputation"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"And draw within the compass of suspect"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"The unviolated honour of your wife."
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Her sober virtue, years and modesty,"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Why at this time the doors are made against you."
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Be ruled by me: depart in patience,"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"And about evening come yourself alone"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"To know the reason of this strange restraint."
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"If by strong hand you offer to break in"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Now in the stirring passage of the day,"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"A vulgar comment will be made of it,"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"And that supposed by the common rout"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"Against your yet ungalled estimation"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"That may with foul intrusion enter in"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"For slander lives upon succession,"
III,I,BALTHAZAR,"For ever housed where it gets possession."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I know a wench of excellent discourse,"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There will we dine. This woman that I mean,"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"My wife--but, I protest, without desert--"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To her will we to dinner."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Get you home"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,"
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me."
III,I,ANGELO,"I'll meet you at that place some hour hence."
III,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense."
III,II,LUCIANA,"And may it be that you have quite forgot"
III,II,LUCIANA,"A husband's office? shall, Antipholus."
III,II,LUCIANA,"Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?"
III,II,LUCIANA,"If you did wed my sister for her wealth,"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Let not my sister read it in your eye;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?"
III,II,LUCIANA,"What simple thief brags of his own attaint?"
III,II,LUCIANA,"'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed"
III,II,LUCIANA,"And let her read it in thy looks at board:"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word."
III,II,LUCIANA,"Alas, poor women! make us but believe,"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Being compact of credit, that you love us;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"We in your motion turn and you may move us."
III,II,LUCIANA,"Then, gentle brother, get you in again;"
III,II,LUCIANA,"Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:"
III,II,LUCIANA,"'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,"
III,II,LUCIANA,"When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"The folded meaning of your words' deceit."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Against my soul's pure truth why labour you"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"To make it wander in an unknown field?"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Are you a god? would you create me new?"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"But if that I am I, then well I know"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Nor to her bed no homage do I owe"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Far more, far more to you do I decline."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And in that glorious supposition think"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"He gains by death that hath such means to die:"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!"
III,II,LUCIANA,"What, are you mad, that you do reason so?"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know."
III,II,LUCIANA,"It is a fault that springeth from your eye."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by."
III,II,LUCIANA,"Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night."
III,II,LUCIANA,"Why call you me love? call my sister so."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thy sister's sister."
III,II,LUCIANA,"That's my sister."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"No;"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"It is thyself, mine own self's better part,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim."
III,II,LUCIANA,"All this my sister is, or else should be."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Give me thy hand."
III,II,LUCIANA,"O, soft, air! hold you still:"
III,II,LUCIANA,"I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"am I myself?"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself."
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself."
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What claim lays she to thee?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"being a beast, she would have me; but that she,"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What is she?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"wondrous fat marriage."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"How dost thou mean a fat marriage?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"and I know not what use to put her to but to make a"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"she'll burn a week longer than the whole world."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What complexion is she of?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"shoes in the grime of it."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"That's a fault that water will mend."
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What's her name?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"hip to hip."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Then she bears some breadth?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"countries in her."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"In what part of her body stands Ireland?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where Scotland?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where France?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"against her heir."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where England?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"by the salt rheum that ran between France and it."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where Spain?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where America, the Indies?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"And, I think, if my breast had not been made of"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"faith and my heart of steel,"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"me turn i' the wheel."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Go hie thee presently, post to the road:"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"An if the wind blow any way from shore,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I will not harbour in this town to-night:"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"If any bark put forth, come to the mart,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Where I will walk till thou return to me."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"If every one knows us and we know none,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone."
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"As from a bear a man would run for life,"
III,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"So fly I from her that would be my wife."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"There's none but witches do inhabit here;"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"She that doth call me husband, even my soul"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Of such enchanting presence and discourse,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Hath almost made me traitor to myself:"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song."
III,II,ANGELO,"Master Antipholus,--"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Ay, that's my name."
III,II,ANGELO,"I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain."
III,II,ANGELO,"I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:"
III,II,ANGELO,"The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What is your will that I shall do with this?"
III,II,ANGELO,"What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not."
III,II,ANGELO,"Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have."
III,II,ANGELO,"Go home with it and please your wife withal;"
III,II,ANGELO,"And soon at supper-time I'll visit you"
III,II,ANGELO,"And then receive my money for the chain."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I pray you, sir, receive the money now,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more."
III,II,ANGELO,"You are a merry man, sir: fare you well."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What I should think of this, I cannot tell:"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"But this I think, there's no man is so vain"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I see a man here needs not live by shifts,"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"When in the streets he meets such golden gifts."
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay"
III,II,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"If any ship put out, then straight away."
IV,I,Second Merchant,"You know since Pentecost the sum is due,"
IV,I,Second Merchant,"And since I have not much importuned you;"
IV,I,Second Merchant,"Nor now I had not, but that I am bound"
IV,I,Second Merchant,"To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:"
IV,I,Second Merchant,"Therefore make present satisfaction,"
IV,I,Second Merchant,"Or I'll attach you by this officer."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Even just the sum that I do owe to you"
IV,I,ANGELO,"Is growing to me by Antipholus,"
IV,I,ANGELO,"And in the instant that I met with you"
IV,I,ANGELO,"He had of me a chain: at five o'clock"
IV,I,ANGELO,"I shall receive the money for the same."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,"
IV,I,ANGELO,"I will discharge my bond and thank you too."
IV,I,Officer,"That labour may you save: see where he comes."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Among my wife and her confederates,"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"For locking me out of my doors by day."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me."
IV,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A man is well holp up that trusts to you:"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I promised your presence and the chain;"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Belike you thought our love would last too long,"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Saving your merry humour, here's the note"
IV,I,ANGELO,"How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,"
IV,I,ANGELO,"The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Which doth amount to three odd ducats more"
IV,I,ANGELO,"Than I stand debted to this gentleman:"
IV,I,ANGELO,"I pray you, see him presently discharged,"
IV,I,ANGELO,"For he is bound to sea and stays but for it."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I am not furnish'd with the present money;"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Besides, I have some business in the town."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Good signior, take the stranger to my house"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And with you take the chain and bid my wife"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Perchance I will be there as soon as you."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Or else you may return without your money."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:"
IV,I,ANGELO,"Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,"
IV,I,ANGELO,"And I, to blame, have held him here too long."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Your breach of promise to the Porpentine."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I should have chid you for not bringing it,"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl."
IV,I,Second Merchant,"The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch."
IV,I,ANGELO,"You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Come, come, you know I gave it you even now."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Either send the chain or send me by some token."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it."
IV,I,Second Merchant,"My business cannot brook this dalliance."
IV,I,Second Merchant,"Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:"
IV,I,Second Merchant,"If not, I'll leave him to the officer."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I answer you! what should I answer you?"
IV,I,ANGELO,"The money that you owe me for the chain."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I owe you none till I receive the chain."
IV,I,ANGELO,"You know I gave it you half an hour since."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so."
IV,I,ANGELO,"You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:"
IV,I,ANGELO,"Consider how it stands upon my credit."
IV,I,Second Merchant,"Well, officer, arrest him at my suit."
IV,I,Officer,"I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me."
IV,I,ANGELO,"This touches me in reputation."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Either consent to pay this sum for me"
IV,I,ANGELO,"Or I attach you by this officer."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Consent to pay thee that I never had!"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,"
IV,I,ANGELO,"I would not spare my brother in this case,"
IV,I,ANGELO,"If he should scorn me so apparently."
IV,I,Officer,"I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I do obey thee till I give thee bail."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"As all the metal in your shop will answer."
IV,I,ANGELO,"Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,"
IV,I,ANGELO,"To your notorious shame; I doubt it not."
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"That stays but till her owner comes aboard,"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae."
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The ship is in her trim; the merry wind"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"But for their owner, master, and yourself."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And told thee to what purpose and what end."
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"You sent me for a rope's end as soon:"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I will debate this matter at more leisure"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And teach your ears to list me with more heed."
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Tell her I am arrested in the street"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!"
IV,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"On, officer, to prison till it come."
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"To Adriana! that is where we dined,"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"She is too big, I hope, for me to compass."
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Thither I must, although against my will,"
IV,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"For servants must their masters' minds fulfil."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"What observation madest thou in this case"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?"
IV,II,LUCIANA,"First he denied you had in him no right."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"He meant he did me none; the more my spite."
IV,II,LUCIANA,"Then swore he that he was a stranger here."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were."
IV,II,LUCIANA,"Then pleaded I for you."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"And what said he?"
IV,II,LUCIANA,"That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?"
IV,II,LUCIANA,"With words that in an honest suit might move."
IV,II,LUCIANA,"First he did praise my beauty, then my speech."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Didst speak him fair?"
IV,II,LUCIANA,"Have patience, I beseech."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Stigmatical in making, worse in mind."
IV,II,LUCIANA,"Who would be jealous then of such a one?"
IV,II,LUCIANA,"No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Ah, but I think him better than I say,"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"And yet would herein others' eyes were worse."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse."
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste."
IV,II,LUCIANA,"How hast thou lost thy breath?"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"By running fast."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell."
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"countermands"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Why, man, what is the matter?"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit."
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell."
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Go fetch it, sister."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"This I wonder at,"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"That he, unknown to me, should be in debt."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Tell me, was he arrested on a band?"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"What, the chain?"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"It was two ere I left him, and now the clock"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"strikes one."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"The hours come back! that did I never hear."
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"very fear."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"worth, to season."
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"That Time comes stealing on by night and day?"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,"
IV,II,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"And bring thy master home immediately."
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--"
IV,II,ADRIANA,"Conceit, my comfort and my injury."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"There's not a man I meet but doth salute me"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"As if I were their well-acquainted friend;"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And every one doth call me by my name."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Some tender money to me; some invite me;"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Some offer me commodities to buy:"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And therewithal took measure of my body."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Sure, these are but imaginary wiles"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here."
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"forsake your liberty."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I understand thee not."
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"morris-pike."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What, thou meanest an officer?"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"give you good rest!'"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"deliver you."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"The fellow is distract, and so am I;"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And here we wander in illusions:"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Some blessed power deliver us from hence!"
IV,III,Courtezan,"Well met, well met, Master Antipholus."
IV,III,Courtezan,"I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:"
IV,III,Courtezan,"Is that the chain you promised me to-day?"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not."
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, is this Mistress Satan?"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"It is the devil."
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"written, they appear to men like angels of light:"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her."
IV,III,Courtezan,"Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir."
IV,III,Courtezan,"Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"long spoon."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Why, Dromio?"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"the devil."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:"
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I conjure thee to leave me and be gone."
IV,III,Courtezan,"Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you."
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"A nut, a cherry-stone;"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"But she, more covetous, would have a chain."
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, be wise: an if you give it her,"
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it."
IV,III,Courtezan,"I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:"
IV,III,Courtezan,"I hope you do not mean to cheat me so."
IV,III,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go."
IV,III,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know."
IV,III,Courtezan,"Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"Else would he never so demean himself."
IV,III,Courtezan,"A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"And for the same he promised me a chain:"
IV,III,Courtezan,"Both one and other he denies me now."
IV,III,Courtezan,"The reason that I gather he is mad,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"Besides this present instance of his rage,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"Of his own doors being shut against his entrance."
IV,III,Courtezan,"Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"On purpose shut the doors against his way."
IV,III,Courtezan,"My way is now to hie home to his house,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"And tell his wife that, being lunatic,"
IV,III,Courtezan,"He rush'd into my house and took perforce"
IV,III,Courtezan,"My ring away. This course I fittest choose;"
IV,III,Courtezan,"For forty ducats is too much to lose."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Fear me not, man; I will not break away:"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And will not lightly trust the messenger"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Here comes my man; I think he brings the money."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But where's the money?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And to that end, sir, I will welcome you."
IV,IV,Officer,"Good sir, be patient."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity."
IV,IV,Officer,"Good, now, hold thy tongue."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Thou whoreson, senseless villain!"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"your blows."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"ears. I have served him from the hour of my"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"rope's-end.'"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Wilt thou still talk?"
IV,IV,Courtezan,"How say you now? is not your husband mad?"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"His incivility confirms no less."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Establish him in his true sense again,"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"And I will please you what you will demand."
IV,IV,LUCIANA,"Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!"
IV,IV,Courtezan,"Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!"
IV,IV,PINCH,"Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There is my hand, and let it feel your ear."
IV,IV,PINCH,"I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,"
IV,IV,PINCH,"To yield possession to my holy prayers"
IV,IV,PINCH,"And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:"
IV,IV,PINCH,"I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"You minion, you, are these your customers?"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Did this companion with the saffron face"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Revel and feast it at my house to-day,"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And I denied to enter in my house?"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"O husband, God doth know you dined at home;"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Where would you had remain'd until this time,"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Free from these slanders and this open shame!"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And did not she herself revile me there?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Sans fable, she herself reviled you there."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And did not I in rage depart from thence?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"In verity you did; my bones bear witness,"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"That since have felt the vigour of his rage."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?"
IV,IV,PINCH,"It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,"
IV,IV,PINCH,"And yielding to him humours well his frenzy."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"By Dromio here, who came in haste for it."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But surely master, not a rag of money."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"He came to me and I deliver'd it."
IV,IV,LUCIANA,"And I am witness with her that she did."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"God and the rope-maker bear me witness"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"That I was sent for nothing but a rope!"
IV,IV,PINCH,"Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;"
IV,IV,PINCH,"I know it by their pale and deadly looks:"
IV,IV,PINCH,"They must be bound and laid in some dark room."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And, gentle master, I received no gold;"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And art confederate with a damned pack"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That would behold in me this shameful sport."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me."
IV,IV,PINCH,"More company! The fiend is strong within him."
IV,IV,LUCIANA,"Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To make a rescue?"
IV,IV,Officer,"Masters, let him go"
IV,IV,Officer,"He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him."
IV,IV,PINCH,"Go bind this man, for he is frantic too."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Hast thou delight to see a wretched man"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Do outrage and displeasure to himself?"
IV,IV,Officer,"He is my prisoner: if I let him go,"
IV,IV,Officer,"The debt he owes will be required of me."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Home to my house. O most unhappy day!"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"O most unhappy strumpet!"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Master, I am here entered in bond for you."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"cry 'The devil!'"
IV,IV,LUCIANA,"God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?"
IV,IV,Officer,"One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"I know the man. What is the sum he owes?"
IV,IV,Officer,"Two hundred ducats."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Say, how grows it due?"
IV,IV,Officer,"Due for a chain your husband had of him."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not."
IV,IV,Courtezan,"When as your husband all in rage to-day"
IV,IV,Courtezan,"Came to my house and took away my ring--"
IV,IV,Courtezan,"The ring I saw upon his finger now--"
IV,IV,Courtezan,"Straight after did I meet him with a chain."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"It may be so, but I did never see it."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:"
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"I long to know the truth hereof at large."
IV,IV,LUCIANA,"God, for thy mercy! they are loose again."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"And come with naked swords."
IV,IV,ADRIANA,"Let's call more help to have them bound again."
IV,IV,Officer,"Away! they'll kill us."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I see these witches are afraid of swords."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"She that would be your wife now ran from you."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I long that we were safe and sound aboard."
IV,IV,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and"
IV,IV,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"turn witch."
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I will not stay to-night for all the town;"
IV,IV,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard."
V,I,ANGELO,"I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;"
V,I,ANGELO,"But, I protest, he had the chain of me,"
V,I,ANGELO,"Though most dishonestly he doth deny it."
V,I,Second Merchant,"How is the man esteemed here in the city?"
V,I,ANGELO,"Of very reverend reputation, sir,"
V,I,ANGELO,"Of credit infinite, highly beloved,"
V,I,ANGELO,"Second to none that lives here in the city:"
V,I,ANGELO,"His word might bear my wealth at any time."
V,I,Second Merchant,"Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks."
V,I,ANGELO,"'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck"
V,I,ANGELO,"Which he forswore most monstrously to have."
V,I,ANGELO,"Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him."
V,I,ANGELO,"Signior Antipholus, I wonder much"
V,I,ANGELO,"That you would put me to this shame and trouble;"
V,I,ANGELO,"And, not without some scandal to yourself,"
V,I,ANGELO,"With circumstance and oaths so to deny"
V,I,ANGELO,"This chain which now you wear so openly:"
V,I,ANGELO,"Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,"
V,I,ANGELO,"You have done wrong to this my honest friend,"
V,I,ANGELO,"Who, but for staying on our controversy,"
V,I,ANGELO,"Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:"
V,I,ANGELO,"This chain you had of me; can you deny it?"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I think I had; I never did deny it."
V,I,Second Merchant,"Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?"
V,I,Second Merchant,"These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee."
V,I,Second Merchant,"Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest"
V,I,Second Merchant,"To walk where any honest man resort."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Against thee presently, if thou darest stand."
V,I,Second Merchant,"I dare, and do defy thee for a villain."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Some get within him, take his sword away:"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house."
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!"
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?"
V,I,ADRIANA,"To fetch my poor distracted husband hence."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Let us come in, that we may bind him fast"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And bear him home for his recovery."
V,I,ANGELO,"I knew he was not in his perfect wits."
V,I,Second Merchant,"I am sorry now that I did draw on him."
V,I,AEMELIA,"How long hath this possession held the man?"
V,I,ADRIANA,"This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And much different from the man he was;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"But till this afternoon his passion"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Ne'er brake into extremity of rage."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?"
V,I,AEMELIA,"A sin prevailing much in youthful men,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Which of these sorrows is he subject to?"
V,I,ADRIANA,"To none of these, except it be the last;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Namely, some love that drew him oft from home."
V,I,AEMELIA,"You should for that have reprehended him."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Why, so I did."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Ay, but not rough enough."
V,I,ADRIANA,"As roughly as my modesty would let me."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Haply, in private."
V,I,ADRIANA,"And in assemblies too."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Ay, but not enough."
V,I,ADRIANA,"It was the copy of our conference:"
V,I,ADRIANA,"In bed he slept not for my urging it;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"At board he fed not for my urging it;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Alone, it was the subject of my theme;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"In company I often glanced it;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Still did I tell him it was vile and bad."
V,I,AEMELIA,"And thereof came it that the man was mad."
V,I,AEMELIA,"The venom clamours of a jealous woman"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth."
V,I,AEMELIA,"It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And therefore comes it that his head is light."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Unquiet meals make ill digestions;"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And what's a fever but a fit of madness?"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue"
V,I,AEMELIA,"But moody and dull melancholy,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And at her heels a huge infectious troop"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?"
V,I,AEMELIA,"In food, in sport and life-preserving rest"
V,I,AEMELIA,"To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:"
V,I,AEMELIA,"The consequence is then thy jealous fits"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Have scared thy husband from the use of wits."
V,I,LUCIANA,"She never reprehended him but mildly,"
V,I,LUCIANA,"When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly."
V,I,LUCIANA,"Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?"
V,I,ADRIANA,"She did betray me to my own reproof."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Good people enter and lay hold on him."
V,I,AEMELIA,"No, not a creature enters in my house."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Then let your servants bring my husband forth."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And it shall privilege him from your hands"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Till I have brought him to his wits again,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Or lose my labour in assaying it."
V,I,ADRIANA,"I will attend my husband, be his nurse,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Diet his sickness, for it is my office,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And will have no attorney but myself;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And therefore let me have him home with me."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Be patient; for I will not let him stir"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Till I have used the approved means I have,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"To make of him a formal man again:"
V,I,AEMELIA,"It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"A charitable duty of my order."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Therefore depart and leave him here with me."
V,I,ADRIANA,"I will not hence and leave my husband here:"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And ill it doth beseem your holiness"
V,I,ADRIANA,"To separate the husband and the wife."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him."
V,I,LUCIANA,"Complain unto the duke of this indignity."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And never rise until my tears and prayers"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Have won his grace to come in person hither"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And take perforce my husband from the abbess."
V,I,Second Merchant,"By this, I think, the dial points at five:"
V,I,Second Merchant,"Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person"
V,I,Second Merchant,"Comes this way to the melancholy vale,"
V,I,Second Merchant,"The place of death and sorry execution,"
V,I,Second Merchant,"Behind the ditches of the abbey here."
V,I,ANGELO,"Upon what cause?"
V,I,Second Merchant,"To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,"
V,I,Second Merchant,"Who put unluckily into this bay"
V,I,Second Merchant,"Against the laws and statutes of this town,"
V,I,Second Merchant,"Beheaded publicly for his offence."
V,I,ANGELO,"See where they come: we will behold his death."
V,I,LUCIANA,"Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Yet once again proclaim it publicly,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"If any friend will pay the sum for him,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"He shall not die; so much we tender him."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong."
V,I,ADRIANA,"May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Whom I made lord of me and all I had,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"At your important letters,--this ill day"
V,I,ADRIANA,"A most outrageous fit of madness took him;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"That desperately he hurried through the street,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"With him his bondman, all as mad as he--"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Doing displeasure to the citizens"
V,I,ADRIANA,"By rushing in their houses, bearing thence"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Once did I get him bound and sent him home,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"That here and there his fury had committed."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"He broke from those that had the guard of him;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And with his mad attendant and himself,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Met us again and madly bent on us,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"We came again to bind them. Then they fled"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And here the abbess shuts the gates on us"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And will not suffer us to fetch him out,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Long since thy husband served me in my wars,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And I to thee engaged a prince's word,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"When thou didst make him master of thy bed,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"To do him all the grace and good I could."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And bid the lady abbess come to me."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"I will determine this before I stir."
V,I,Servant,"O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!"
V,I,Servant,"My master and his man are both broke loose,"
V,I,Servant,"Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor"
V,I,Servant,"Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;"
V,I,Servant,"And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him"
V,I,Servant,"Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:"
V,I,Servant,"My master preaches patience to him and the while"
V,I,Servant,"His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,"
V,I,Servant,"And sure, unless you send some present help,"
V,I,Servant,"Between them they will kill the conjurer."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And that is false thou dost report to us."
V,I,Servant,"Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;"
V,I,Servant,"I have not breathed almost since I did see it."
V,I,Servant,"He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,"
V,I,Servant,"To scorch your face and to disfigure you."
V,I,Servant,"Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"That he is borne about invisible:"
V,I,ADRIANA,"Even now we housed him in the abbey here;"
V,I,ADRIANA,"And now he's there, past thought of human reason."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Even for the service that long since I did thee,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"When I bestrid thee in the wars and took"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice."
V,I,AEGEON,"Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,"
V,I,AEGEON,"I see my son Antipholus and Dromio."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That hath abused and dishonour'd me"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Even in the strength and height of injury!"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Beyond imagination is the wrong"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That she this day hath shameless thrown on me."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Discover how, and thou shalt find me just."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"While she with harlots feasted in my house."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?"
V,I,ADRIANA,"No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister"
V,I,ADRIANA,"To-day did dine together. So befall my soul"
V,I,ADRIANA,"As this is false he burdens me withal!"
V,I,LUCIANA,"Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,"
V,I,LUCIANA,"But she tells to your highness simple truth!"
V,I,ANGELO,"O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:"
V,I,ANGELO,"In this the madman justly chargeth them."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"My liege, I am advised what I say,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Could witness it, for he was with me then;"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Where Balthazar and I did dine together."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I went to seek him: in the street I met him"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And in his company that gentleman."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"That I this day of him received the chain,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"He did arrest me with an officer."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I did obey, and sent my peasant home"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"For certain ducats: he with none return'd"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Then fairly I bespoke the officer"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To go in person with me to my house."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"By the way we met"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"My wife, her sister, and a rabble more"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Of vile confederates. Along with them"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A mere anatomy, a mountebank,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And in a dark and dankish vault at home"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There left me and my man, both bound together;"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I gain'd my freedom, and immediately"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"To give me ample satisfaction"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"For these deep shames and great indignities."
V,I,ANGELO,"My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,"
V,I,ANGELO,"That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"But had he such a chain of thee or no?"
V,I,ANGELO,"He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,"
V,I,ANGELO,"These people saw the chain about his neck."
V,I,Second Merchant,"Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine"
V,I,Second Merchant,"Heard you confess you had the chain of him"
V,I,Second Merchant,"After you first forswore it on the mart:"
V,I,Second Merchant,"And thereupon I drew my sword on you;"
V,I,Second Merchant,"And then you fled into this abbey here,"
V,I,Second Merchant,"From whence, I think, you are come by miracle."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I never came within these abbey-walls,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And this is false you burden me withal."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Why, what an intricate impeach is this!"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"If here you housed him, here he would have been;"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine."
V,I,Courtezan,"He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?"
V,I,Courtezan,"As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"I think you are all mated or stark mad."
V,I,AEGEON,"Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:"
V,I,AEGEON,"Haply I see a friend will save my life"
V,I,AEGEON,"And pay the sum that may deliver me."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt."
V,I,AEGEON,"Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?"
V,I,AEGEON,"And is not that your bondman, Dromio?"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Within this hour I was his bondman sir,"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Now am I Dromio and his man unbound."
V,I,AEGEON,"I am sure you both of you remember me."
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For lately we were bound, as you are now"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?"
V,I,AEGEON,"Why look you strange on me? you know me well."
V,I,AEGEON,"O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,"
V,I,AEGEON,"And careful hours with time's deformed hand"
V,I,AEGEON,"Have written strange defeatures in my face:"
V,I,AEGEON,"But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Neither."
V,I,AEGEON,"Dromio, nor thou?"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"No, trust me, sir, nor I."
V,I,AEGEON,"I am sure thou dost."
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"man denies, you are now bound to believe him."
V,I,AEGEON,"Not know my voice! O time's extremity,"
V,I,AEGEON,"Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue"
V,I,AEGEON,"In seven short years, that here my only son"
V,I,AEGEON,"Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?"
V,I,AEGEON,"Though now this grained face of mine be hid"
V,I,AEGEON,"In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,"
V,I,AEGEON,"And all the conduits of my blood froze up,"
V,I,AEGEON,"Yet hath my night of life some memory,"
V,I,AEGEON,"My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,"
V,I,AEGEON,"My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:"
V,I,AEGEON,"All these old witnesses--I cannot err--"
V,I,AEGEON,"Tell me thou art my son Antipholus."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I never saw my father in my life."
V,I,AEGEON,"But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,"
V,I,AEGEON,"Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,"
V,I,AEGEON,"Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"The duke and all that know me in the city"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Can witness with me that it is not so"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Have I been patron to Antipholus,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"I see thy age and dangers make thee dote."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd."
V,I,ADRIANA,"I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"One of these men is Genius to the other;"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And so of these. Which is the natural man,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And which the spirit? who deciphers them?"
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"I, sir, am Dromio; command him away."
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?"
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"O, my old master! who hath bound him here?"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And gain a husband by his liberty."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man"
V,I,AEMELIA,"That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia"
V,I,AEMELIA,"That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:"
V,I,AEMELIA,"O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And speak unto the same AEmilia!"
V,I,AEGEON,"If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:"
V,I,AEGEON,"If thou art she, tell me where is that son"
V,I,AEGEON,"That floated with thee on the fatal raft?"
V,I,AEMELIA,"By men of Epidamnum he and I"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And the twin Dromio all were taken up;"
V,I,AEMELIA,"But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth"
V,I,AEMELIA,"By force took Dromio and my son from them"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And me they left with those of Epidamnum."
V,I,AEMELIA,"What then became of them I cannot tell"
V,I,AEMELIA,"I to this fortune that you see me in."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Why, here begins his morning story right;"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"These two Antipholuses, these two so like,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"These are the parents to these children,"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Which accidentally are met together."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And I with him."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle."
V,I,ADRIANA,"Which of you two did dine with me to-day?"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I, gentle mistress."
V,I,ADRIANA,"And are not you my husband?"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"No; I say nay to that."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And so do I; yet did she call me so:"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Did call me brother."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"What I told you then,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I hope I shall have leisure to make good;"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"If this be not a dream I see and hear."
V,I,ANGELO,"That is the chain, sir, which you had of me."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I think it be, sir; I deny it not."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"And you, sir, for this chain arrested me."
V,I,ANGELO,"I think I did, sir; I deny it not."
V,I,ADRIANA,"I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,"
V,I,ADRIANA,"By Dromio; but I think he brought it not."
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"No, none by me."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"This purse of ducats I received from you,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And Dromio, my man, did bring them me."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"I see we still did meet each other's man,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"And thereupon these errors are arose."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"These ducats pawn I for my father here."
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"It shall not need; thy father hath his life."
V,I,Courtezan,"Sir, I must have that diamond from you."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains"
V,I,AEMELIA,"To go with us into the abbey here"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And all that are assembled in this place,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"That by this sympathized one day's error"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And we shall make full satisfaction."
V,I,AEMELIA,"Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Of you, my sons; and till this present hour"
V,I,AEMELIA,"My heavy burden ne'er delivered."
V,I,AEMELIA,"The duke, my husband and my children both,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"And you the calendars of their nativity,"
V,I,AEMELIA,"Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;"
V,I,AEMELIA,"After so long grief, such festivity!"
V,I,DUKE SOLINUS,"With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast."
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS,"Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?"
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur."
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:"
V,I,ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE,"Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him."
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"There is a fat friend at your master's house,"
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:"
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"She now shall be my sister, not my wife."
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth."
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Will you walk in to see their gossiping?"
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"Not I, sir; you are my elder."
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"That's a question: how shall we try it?"
V,I,DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,"We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first."
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, then, thus:"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"We came into the world like brother and brother;"
V,I,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another."
