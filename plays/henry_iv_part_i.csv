I,I,KING HENRY IV,"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"And breathe short-winded accents of new broils"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"To be commenced in strands afar remote."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"No more the thirsty entrance of this soil"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"All of one nature, of one substance bred,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Did lately meet in the intestine shock"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"And furious close of civil butchery"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"March all one way and be no more opposed"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"We are impressed and engaged to fight,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"To chase these pagans in those holy fields"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"For our advantage on the bitter cross."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"But this our purpose now is twelve month old,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"What yesternight our council did decree"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"In forwarding this dear expedience."
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"My liege, this haste was hot in question,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"And many limits of the charge set down"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"But yesternight: when all athwart there came"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Against the irregular and wild Glendower,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"A thousand of his people butchered;"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Such beastly shameless transformation,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"By those Welshwomen done as may not be"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Without much shame retold or spoken of."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"It seems then that the tidings of this broil"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Brake off our business for the Holy Land."
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"For more uneven and unwelcome news"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Came from the north and thus it did import:"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"That ever-valiant and approved Scot,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"At Holmedon met,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"As by discharge of their artillery,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"And shape of likelihood, the news was told;"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"For he that brought them, in the very heat"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"And pride of their contention did take horse,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Uncertain of the issue any way."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Stain'd with the variation of each soil"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"And is not this an honourable spoil?"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"In faith,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"It is a conquest for a prince to boast of."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"In envy that my Lord Northumberland"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Should be the father to so blest a son,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"See riot and dishonour stain the brow"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Then would I have his Harry, and he mine."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Which he in this adventure hath surprised,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife."
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Malevolent to you in all aspects;"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up"
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"The crest of youth against your dignity."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"But I have sent for him to answer this;"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"And for this cause awhile we must neglect"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Our holy purpose to Jerusalem."
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"But come yourself with speed to us again;"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"For more is to be said and to be done"
I,I,KING HENRY IV,"Than out of anger can be uttered."
I,I,WESTMORELAND,"I will, my liege."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"the time of the day."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"thou wilt have none,--"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"What, none?"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"prologue to an egg and butter."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"us that are squires of the night's body be called"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"moon; and let men say we be men of good government,"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"buff jerkin?"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"time and oft."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"and where it would not, I have used my credit."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"No; thou shalt."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"you."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"For obtaining of suits?"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"as a gib cat or a lugged bear."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Or an old lion, or a lover's lute."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Moor-ditch?"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"commodity of good names were to be bought. An old"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"lord of the council rated me the other day in the"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"yet he talked wisely, and in the street too."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"streets, and no man regards it."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"should speak truly, little better than one of the"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"I'll be damned for never a king's son in"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Christendom."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"do not, call me villain and baffle me."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"to purse-taking."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"man to labour in his vocation."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"a true man."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Good morrow, Ned."
I,II,POINS,"Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?"
I,II,POINS,"what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how"
I,II,POINS,"agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou"
I,II,POINS,"soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira"
I,II,POINS,"and a cold capon's leg?"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"proverbs: he will give the devil his due."
I,II,POINS,"Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Else he had been damned for cozening the devil."
I,II,POINS,"But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four"
I,II,POINS,"o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going"
I,II,POINS,"to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders"
I,II,POINS,"riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards"
I,II,POINS,"for you all; you have horses for yourselves:"
I,II,POINS,"Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke"
I,II,POINS,"supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it"
I,II,POINS,"as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff"
I,II,POINS,"your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry"
I,II,POINS,"at home and be hanged."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"I'll hang you for going."
I,II,POINS,"You will, chops?"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Hal, wilt thou make one?"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Why, that's well said."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I care not."
I,II,POINS,"Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:"
I,II,POINS,"I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure"
I,II,POINS,"that he shall go."
I,II,FALSTAFF,"Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"move and what he hears may be believed, that the"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"thief; for the poor abuses of the time want"
I,II,FALSTAFF,"countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!"
I,II,POINS,"Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us"
I,II,POINS,"to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot"
I,II,POINS,"manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill"
I,II,POINS,"shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:"
I,II,POINS,"yourself and I will not be there; and when they"
I,II,POINS,"have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut"
I,II,POINS,"this head off from my shoulders."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"How shall we part with them in setting forth?"
I,II,POINS,"Why, we will set forth before or after them, and"
I,II,POINS,"appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at"
I,II,POINS,"our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure"
I,II,POINS,"upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have"
I,II,POINS,"no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"horses, by our habits and by every other"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"appointment, to be ourselves."
I,II,POINS,"Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them"
I,II,POINS,"in the wood; our vizards we will change after we"
I,II,POINS,"leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram"
I,II,POINS,"for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us."
I,II,POINS,"Well, for two of them, I know them to be as"
I,II,POINS,"true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the"
I,II,POINS,"third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll"
I,II,POINS,"forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the"
I,II,POINS,"incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will"
I,II,POINS,"tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at"
I,II,POINS,"least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what"
I,II,POINS,"extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this"
I,II,POINS,"lies the jest."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"there I'll sup. Farewell."
I,II,POINS,"Farewell, my lord."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I know you all, and will awhile uphold"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"The unyoked humour of your idleness:"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Yet herein will I imitate the sun,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Who doth permit the base contagious clouds"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"To smother up his beauty from the world,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"That, when he please again to be himself,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"By breaking through the foul and ugly mists"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Of vapours that did seem to strangle him."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"If all the year were playing holidays,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"To sport would be as tedious as to work;"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"So, when this loose behavior I throw off"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And pay the debt I never promised,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"By how much better than my word I am,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And like bright metal on a sullen ground,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Than that which hath no foil to set it off."
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;"
I,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Redeeming time when men think least I will."
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"My blood hath been too cold and temperate,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Unapt to stir at these indignities,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"And you have found me; for accordingly"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"You tread upon my patience: but be sure"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"I will from henceforth rather be myself,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"And therefore lost that title of respect"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The scourge of greatness to be used on it;"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And that same greatness too which our own hands"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Have holp to make so portly."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord.--"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Danger and disobedience in thine eye:"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"And majesty might never yet endure"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"The moody frontier of a servant brow."
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"You have good leave to leave us: when we need"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Your use and counsel, we shall send for you."
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"You were about to speak."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yea, my good lord."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Were, as he says, not with such strength denied"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"As is deliver'd to your majesty:"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Either envy, therefore, or misprison"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Is guilty of this fault and not my son."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"My liege, I did deny no prisoners."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"But I remember, when the fight was done,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He was perfumed like a milliner;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"A pouncet-box, which ever and anon"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He gave his nose and took't away again;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Who therewith angry, when it next came there,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Betwixt the wind and his nobility."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"With many holiday and lady terms"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"My prisoners in your majesty's behalf."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To be so pester'd with a popinjay,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Out of my grief and my impatience,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He should or he should not; for he made me mad"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And that it was great pity, so it was,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He would himself have been a soldier."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I answer'd indirectly, as I said;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And I beseech you, let not his report"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Come current for an accusation"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Betwixt my love and your high majesty."
I,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,"
I,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said"
I,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"To such a person and in such a place,"
I,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"At such a time, with all the rest retold,"
I,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"May reasonably die and never rise"
I,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"To do him wrong or any way impeach"
I,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"What then he said, so he unsay it now."
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"But with proviso and exception,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"That we at our own charge shall ransom straight"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"The lives of those that he did lead to fight"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"When they have lost and forfeited themselves?"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"No, on the barren mountains let him starve;"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"For I shall never hold that man my friend"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"To ransom home revolted Mortimer."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Revolted Mortimer!"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"But by the chance of war; to prove that true"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"In single opposition, hand to hand,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He did confound the best part of an hour"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"In changing hardiment with great Glendower:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Three times they breathed and three times did"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"they drink,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Bloodstained with these valiant combatants."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Never did base and rotten policy"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Colour her working with such deadly wounds;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Nor could the noble Mortimer"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Receive so many, and all willingly:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Then let not him be slander'd with revolt."
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"He never did encounter with Glendower:"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"I tell thee,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"He durst as well have met the devil alone"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"As Owen Glendower for an enemy."
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Or you shall hear in such a kind from me"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,"
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"We licence your departure with your son."
I,III,KING HENRY IV,"Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"An if the devil come and roar for them,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I will not send them: I will after straight"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Albeit I make a hazard of my head."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Here comes your uncle."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Speak of Mortimer!"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Want mercy, if I do not join with him:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"As high in the air as this unthankful king,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Who struck this heat up after I was gone?"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And when I urged the ransom once again"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Trembling even at the name of Mortimer."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By Richard that dead is the next of blood?"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He was; I heard the proclamation:"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And then it was when the unhappy king,"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Upon his Irish expedition;"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"From whence he intercepted did return"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To be deposed and shortly murdered."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Live scandalized and foully spoken of."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Heir to the crown?"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He did; myself did hear it."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"That wished him on the barren mountains starve."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"But shall it be that you, that set the crown"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Upon the head of this forgetful man"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And for his sake wear the detested blot"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Of murderous subornation, shall it be,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"That you a world of curses undergo,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Being the agents, or base second means,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"O, pardon me that I descend so low,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To show the line and the predicament"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Wherein you range under this subtle king;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Or fill up chronicles in time to come,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"That men of your nobility and power"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And shall it in more shame be further spoken,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"By him for whom these shames ye underwent?"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Into the good thoughts of the world again,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Of this proud king, who studies day and night"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To answer all the debt he owes to you"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Therefore, I say--"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Peace, cousin, say no more:"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And now I will unclasp a secret book,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And to your quick-conceiving discontents"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As full of peril and adventurous spirit"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"On the unsteadfast footing of a spear."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Send danger from the east unto the west,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"So honour cross it from the north to south,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To rouse a lion than to start a hare!"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Imagination of some great exploit"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Drives him beyond the bounds of patience."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Or dive into the bottom of the deep,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"So he that doth redeem her thence might wear"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Without corrival, all her dignities:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"But out upon this half-faced fellowship!"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"He apprehends a world of figures here,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"But not the form of what he should attend."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Good cousin, give me audience for a while."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I cry you mercy."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Those same noble Scots"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That are your prisoners,--"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I'll keep them all;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I'll keep them, by this hand."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"You start away"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And lend no ear unto my purposes."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Those prisoners you shall keep."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Nay, I will; that's flat:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He said he would not ransom Mortimer;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"But I will find him when he lies asleep,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Nay,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To keep his anger still in motion."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Hear you, cousin; a word."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"All studies here I solemnly defy,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"But that I think his father loves him not"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And would be glad he met with some mischance,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"When you are better temper'd to attend."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Art thou to break into this woman's mood,"
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"'Sblood!--"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"At Berkley castle."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"You say true:"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Why, what a candy deal of courtesy"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Nay, if you have not, to it again;"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We will stay your leisure."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I have done, i' faith."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Then once more to your Scottish prisoners."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Deliver them up without their ransom straight,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And make the Douglas' son your only mean"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Which I shall send you written, be assured,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Will easily be granted. You, my lord,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Shall secretly into the bosom creep"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The archbishop."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Of York, is it not?"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"True; who bears hard"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I speak not this in estimation,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As what I think might be, but what I know"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Is ruminated, plotted and set down,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And only stays but to behold the face"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of that occasion that shall bring it on."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"I smell it: upon my life, it will do well."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"And then the power of Scotland and of York,"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"To join with Mortimer, ha?"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And so they shall."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To save our heads by raising of a head;"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For, bear ourselves as even as we can,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The king will always think him in our debt,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Till he hath found a time to pay us home:"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And see already how he doth begin"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To make us strangers to his looks of love."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Cousin, farewell: no further go in this"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Than I by letters shall direct your course."
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,"
I,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Which now we hold at much uncertainty."
I,III,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust."
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short"
I,III,HOTSPUR,"Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!"
II,I,First Carrier,"Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be"
II,I,First Carrier,"hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and"
II,I,First Carrier,"yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!"
II,I,First Carrier,"I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks"
II,I,First Carrier,"in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out"
II,I,First Carrier,"of all cess."
II,I,Second Carrier,"Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that"
II,I,Second Carrier,"is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this"
II,I,Second Carrier,"house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died."
II,I,First Carrier,"Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats"
II,I,First Carrier,"rose; it was the death of him."
II,I,Second Carrier,"I think this be the most villanous house in all"
II,I,Second Carrier,"London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench."
II,I,First Carrier,"Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king"
II,I,First Carrier,"christen could be better bit than I have been since"
II,I,First Carrier,"the first cock."
II,I,Second Carrier,"Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we"
II,I,Second Carrier,"leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds"
II,I,Second Carrier,"fleas like a loach."
II,I,First Carrier,"What, ostler! come away and be hanged!"
II,I,Second Carrier,"I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,"
II,I,Second Carrier,"to be delivered as far as Charing-cross."
II,I,First Carrier,"God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite"
II,I,First Carrier,"starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou"
II,I,First Carrier,"never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An"
II,I,First Carrier,"'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate"
II,I,First Carrier,"on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!"
II,I,First Carrier,"hast thou no faith in thee?"
II,I,GADSHILL,"Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?"
II,I,First Carrier,"I think it be two o'clock."
II,I,GADSHILL,"I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding"
II,I,GADSHILL,"in the stable."
II,I,First Carrier,"Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith."
II,I,GADSHILL,"I pray thee, lend me thine."
II,I,Second Carrier,"Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth"
II,I,Second Carrier,"he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first."
II,I,GADSHILL,"Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?"
II,I,Second Carrier,"Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant"
II,I,Second Carrier,"thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the"
II,I,Second Carrier,"gentleman: they will along with company, for they"
II,I,Second Carrier,"have great charge."
II,I,GADSHILL,"What, ho! chamberlain!"
II,I,GADSHILL,"That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the"
II,I,GADSHILL,"chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking"
II,I,GADSHILL,"of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;"
II,I,GADSHILL,"thou layest the plot how."
II,I,Chamberlain,"Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that"
II,I,Chamberlain,"I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the"
II,I,Chamberlain,"wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with"
II,I,Chamberlain,"him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his"
II,I,Chamberlain,"company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one"
II,I,Chamberlain,"that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what."
II,I,Chamberlain,"They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;"
II,I,Chamberlain,"they will away presently."
II,I,GADSHILL,"Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'"
II,I,GADSHILL,"clerks, I'll give thee this neck."
II,I,Chamberlain,"No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the"
II,I,Chamberlain,"hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas"
II,I,Chamberlain,"as truly as a man of falsehood may."
II,I,GADSHILL,"What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,"
II,I,GADSHILL,"I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old"
II,I,GADSHILL,"Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no"
II,I,GADSHILL,"starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou"
II,I,GADSHILL,"dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are"
II,I,GADSHILL,"content to do the profession some grace; that would,"
II,I,GADSHILL,"if matters should be looked into, for their own"
II,I,GADSHILL,"credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no"
II,I,GADSHILL,"foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,"
II,I,GADSHILL,"none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;"
II,I,GADSHILL,"but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and"
II,I,GADSHILL,"great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will"
II,I,GADSHILL,"strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than"
II,I,GADSHILL,"drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,"
II,I,GADSHILL,"I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the"
II,I,GADSHILL,"commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey"
II,I,GADSHILL,"on her, for they ride up and down on her and make"
II,I,GADSHILL,"her their boots."
II,I,Chamberlain,"What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold"
II,I,Chamberlain,"out water in foul way?"
II,I,GADSHILL,"She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We"
II,I,GADSHILL,"steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt"
II,I,GADSHILL,"of fern-seed, we walk invisible."
II,I,Chamberlain,"Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to"
II,I,Chamberlain,"the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible."
II,I,GADSHILL,"Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our"
II,I,GADSHILL,"purchase, as I am a true man."
II,I,Chamberlain,"Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief."
II,I,GADSHILL,"Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the"
II,I,GADSHILL,"ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,"
II,I,GADSHILL,"you muddy knave."
II,II,POINS,"Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's"
II,II,POINS,"horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet."
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Stand close."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"thou keep!"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Where's Poins, Hal?"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"not but to die a fair death for all this, if I"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"forsworn his company hourly any time this two and"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"of travellers."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"good king's son."
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it."
II,II,GADSHILL,"Stand."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"So I do, against my will."
II,II,POINS,"O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,"
II,II,POINS,"what news?"
II,II,BARDOLPH,"Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's"
II,II,BARDOLPH,"money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going"
II,II,BARDOLPH,"to the king's exchequer."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern."
II,II,GADSHILL,"There's enough to make us all."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"To be hanged."
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"from your encounter, then they light on us."
II,II,PETO,"How many be there of them?"
II,II,GADSHILL,"Some eight or ten."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"'Zounds, will they not rob us?"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"but yet no coward, Hal."
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, we leave that to the proof."
II,II,POINS,"Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:"
II,II,POINS,"when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him."
II,II,POINS,"Farewell, and stand fast."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged."
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Ned, where are our disguises?"
II,II,POINS,"Here, hard by: stand close."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"every man to his business."
II,II,First Traveller,"Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down"
II,II,First Traveller,"the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs."
II,II,Thieves,"Stand!"
II,II,Travellers,"Jesus bless us!"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"hate us youth: down with them: fleece them."
II,II,Travellers,"O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith."
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"would be argument for a week, laughter for a month"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"and a good jest for ever."
II,II,POINS,"Stand close; I hear them coming."
II,II,FALSTAFF,"Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's"
II,II,FALSTAFF,"no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck."
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Your money!"
II,II,POINS,"Villains!"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"So strongly that they dare not meet each other;"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Each takes his fellow for an officer."
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And lards the lean earth as he walks along:"
II,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him."
II,II,POINS,"How the rogue roar'd!"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"then? In respect of the love he bears our house:"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"friends true and constant: a good plot, good"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"next month? and are they not some of them set"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"forward to-night."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours."
II,III,LADY PERCY,"O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"For what offence have I this fortnight been"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"And start so often when thou sit'st alone?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"And given my treasures and my rights of thee"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"And all the currents of a heady fight."
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Such as we see when men restrain their breath"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"And I must know it, else he loves me not."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"What, ho!"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Is Gilliams with the packet gone?"
II,III,Servant,"He is, my lord, an hour ago."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?"
II,III,Servant,"One horse, my lord, he brought even now."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?"
II,III,Servant,"It is, my lord."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"That roan shall by my throne."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Bid Butler lead him forth into the park."
II,III,LADY PERCY,"But hear you, my lord."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"What say'st thou, my lady?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"What is it carries you away?"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Why, my horse, my love, my horse."
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Out, you mad-headed ape!"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"As you are toss'd with. In faith,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"I'll know your business, Harry, that I will."
II,III,LADY PERCY,"I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"About his title, and hath sent for you"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"To line his enterprise: but if you go,--"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"So far afoot, I shall be weary, love."
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Come, come, you paraquito, answer me"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Directly unto this question that I ask:"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"An if thou wilt not tell me all things true."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Away,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"have with me?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Well, do not then; for since you love me not,"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"I will not love myself. Do you not love me?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Come, wilt thou see me ride?"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"And when I am on horseback, I will swear"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"I must not have you henceforth question me"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"I know you wise, but yet no farther wise"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"But yet a woman: and for secrecy,"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"No lady closer; for I well believe"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate."
II,III,LADY PERCY,"How! so far?"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Whither I go, thither shall you go too;"
II,III,HOTSPUR,"To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you."
II,III,HOTSPUR,"Will this content you, Kate?"
II,III,LADY PERCY,"It must of force."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"thy hand to laugh a little."
II,IV,POINS,"Where hast been, Hal?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"score hogsheads. I have sounded the very"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"They take it already upon their salvation, that"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"am king of England, I shall command all the good"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"that I can drink with any tinker in his own language"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"never spake other English in his life than 'Eight"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll show thee a precedent."
II,IV,POINS,"Francis!"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou art perfect."
II,IV,POINS,"Francis!"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Come hither, Francis."
II,IV,FRANCIS,"My lord?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"How long hast thou to serve, Francis?"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"Anon, anon, sir."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"a fair pair of heels and run from it?"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"England, I could find in my heart."
II,IV,FRANCIS,"Anon, sir."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"How old art thou, Francis?"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"O Lord, I would it had been two!"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it."
II,IV,FRANCIS,"Anon, anon."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis;"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"thou wilt. But, Francis!"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"My lord?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"O Lord, sir, who do you mean?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much."
II,IV,FRANCIS,"What, sir?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?"
II,IV,Vintner,"What, standest thou still, and hearest such a"
II,IV,Vintner,"calling? Look to the guests within."
II,IV,Vintner,"My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are"
II,IV,Vintner,"at the door: shall I let them in?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Let them alone awhile, and then open the door."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Poins!"
II,IV,POINS,"Anon, anon, sir."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"the door: shall we be merry?"
II,IV,POINS,"As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what"
II,IV,POINS,"cunning match have you made with this jest of the"
II,IV,POINS,"drawer? come, what's the issue?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I am now of all humours that have showed themselves"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What's o'clock, Francis?"
II,IV,FRANCIS,"Anon, anon, sir."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow."
II,IV,POINS,"Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"shotten herring. There live not three good men"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?"
II,IV,POINS,"'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the"
II,IV,POINS,"Lord, I'll stab thee."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"back: call you that backing of your friends? A"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"plague upon such backing! give me them that will"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"drunk to-day."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"drunkest last."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"All's one for that."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"A plague of all cowards, still say I."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What's the matter?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"What's the matter! there be four of us here have"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"ta'en a thousand pound this day morning."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Where is it, Jack? where is it?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"poor four of us."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What, a hundred, man?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"miracle. I am eight times thrust through the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"through and through; my sword hacked like a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Speak, sirs; how was it?"
II,IV,GADSHILL,"We four set upon some dozen--"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Sixteen at least, my lord."
II,IV,GADSHILL,"And bound them."
II,IV,PETO,"No, no, they were not bound."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew."
II,IV,GADSHILL,"As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"And unbound the rest, and then come in the other."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What, fought you with them all?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Jack, then am I no two-legged creature."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Pray God you have not murdered some of them."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What, four? thou saidst but two even now."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Four, Hal; I told thee four."
II,IV,POINS,"Ay, ay, he said four."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"points in my target, thus."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Seven? why, there were but four even now."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"In buckram?"
II,IV,POINS,"Ay, four, in buckram suits."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear me, Hal?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Ay, and mark thee too, Jack."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"in buckram that I told thee of--"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"So, two more already."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Their points being broken,--"
II,IV,POINS,"Down fell their hose."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"the eleven I paid."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"not see thy hand."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"These lies are like their father that begets them;"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"the truth?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?"
II,IV,POINS,"Come, your reason, Jack, your reason."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"compulsion, I."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"this huge hill of flesh,--"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"for breath to utter what is like thee! you"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"standing-tuck,--"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"hear me speak but this."
II,IV,POINS,"Mark, Jack."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"thou now find out to hide thee from this open and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"apparent shame?"
II,IV,POINS,"Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"coward on instinct. I shall think the better of"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"merry? shall we have a play extempore?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Content; and the argument shall be thy running away."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!"
II,IV,Hostess,"O Jesu, my lord the prince!"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"me?"
II,IV,Hostess,"Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at"
II,IV,Hostess,"door would speak with you: he says he comes from"
II,IV,Hostess,"your father."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"send him back again to my mother."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"What manner of man is he?"
II,IV,Hostess,"An old man."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I give him his answer?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Prithee, do, Jack."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"'Faith, and I'll send him packing."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"prince; no, fie!"
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"'Faith, I ran when I saw others run."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"sword so hacked?"
II,IV,PETO,"Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would"
II,IV,PETO,"swear truth out of England but he would make you"
II,IV,PETO,"believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like."
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to"
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments"
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I"
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed"
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"to hear his monstrous devices."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"instinct hadst thou for it?"
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold"
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"these exhalations?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I do."
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"What think you they portend?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Hot livers and cold purses."
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"Choler, my lord, if rightly taken."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"No, if rightly taken, halter."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, my sweet creature of bombast!"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"hook--what a plague call you him?"
II,IV,POINS,"O, Glendower."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"perpendicular,--"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"He that rides at high speed and with his pistol"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"kills a sparrow flying."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"You have hit it."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"So did he never the sparrow."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"for running!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Yes, Jack, upon instinct."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"beard is turned white with the news: you may buy"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"land now as cheap as stinking mackerel."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"art not thou horrible afeard? thou being"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"it?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"particulars of my life."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"crown for a pitiful bald crown!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"in King Cambyses' vein."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, here is my leg."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility."
II,IV,Hostess,"O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain."
II,IV,Hostess,"O, the father, how he holds his countenance!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes."
II,IV,Hostess,"O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry"
II,IV,Hostess,"players as ever I see!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"which thou hast often heard of and it is known to"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What manner of man, an it like your majesty?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"thou been this month?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"and I'll play my father."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, here I am set."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"And here I stand: judge, my masters."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Now, Harry, whence come you?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"My noble lord, from Eastcheap."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"The complaints I hear of thee are grievous."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"ye for a young prince, i' faith."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I would your grace would take me with you: whom"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"means your grace?"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"That villanous abominable misleader of youth,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"My lord, the man I know."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I know thou dost."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"were to say more than I know. That he is old, the"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I do, I will."
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most"
II,IV,BARDOLPH,"monstrous watch is at the door."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"say in the behalf of that Falstaff."
II,IV,Hostess,"O Jesu, my lord, my lord!"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"what's the matter?"
II,IV,Hostess,"The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they"
II,IV,Hostess,"are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"without seeming so."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"And thou a natural coward, without instinct."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"conscience."
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"Both which I have had: but their date is out, and"
II,IV,FALSTAFF,"therefore I'll hide me."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Call in the sheriff."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?"
II,IV,Sheriff,"First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry"
II,IV,Sheriff,"Hath follow'd certain men unto this house."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What men?"
II,IV,Sheriff,"One of them is well known, my gracious lord,"
II,IV,Sheriff,"A gross fat man."
II,IV,Carrier,"As fat as butter."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"The man, I do assure you, is not here;"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"For I myself at this time have employ'd him."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Send him to answer thee, or any man,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"For any thing he shall be charged withal:"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"And so let me entreat you leave the house."
II,IV,Sheriff,"I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen"
II,IV,Sheriff,"Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"He shall be answerable; and so farewell."
II,IV,Sheriff,"Good night, my noble lord."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I think it is good morrow, is it not?"
II,IV,Sheriff,"Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"call him forth."
II,IV,PETO,"Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and"
II,IV,PETO,"snorting like a horse."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What hast thou found?"
II,IV,PETO,"Nothing but papers, my lord."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Let's see what they be: read them."
II,IV,PETO,"Item, Sauce,. . . 4d."
II,IV,PETO,"Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d."
II,IV,PETO,"Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d."
II,IV,PETO,"Item, Bread,        ob."
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"charge of foot; and I know his death will be a"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in"
II,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto."
II,IV,PETO,"Good morrow, good my lord."
III,I,MORTIMER,"These promises are fair, the parties sure,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"And our induction full of prosperous hope."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Will you sit down?"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I have forgot the map."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"No, here it is."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"For by that name as oft as Lancaster"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I cannot blame him: at my nativity"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Of burning cressets; and at my birth"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"The frame and huge foundation of the earth"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Shaked like a coward."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Why, so it would have done at the same season, if"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"had never been born."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I say the earth did shake when I was born."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And I say the earth was not of my mind,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"If you suppose as fearing you it shook."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And not in fear of your nativity."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"By the imprisoning of unruly wind"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"In passion shook."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Cousin, of many men"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"To tell you once again that at my birth"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And all the courses of my life do show"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I am not in the roll of common men."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And bring him out that is but woman's son"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Can trace me in the tedious ways of art"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And hold me pace in deep experiments."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I think there's no man speaks better Welsh."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I'll to dinner."
III,I,MORTIMER,"Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I can call spirits from the vasty deep."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Why, so can I, or so can any man;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"But will they come when you do call for them?"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"The devil."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Bootless home and weather-beaten back."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Home without boots, and in foul weather too!"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"According to our threefold order ta'en?"
III,I,MORTIMER,"The archdeacon hath divided it"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Into three limits very equally:"
III,I,MORTIMER,"England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"By south and east is to my part assign'd:"
III,I,MORTIMER,"All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"And all the fertile land within that bound,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you"
III,I,MORTIMER,"The remnant northward, lying off from Trent."
III,I,MORTIMER,"And our indentures tripartite are drawn;"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Which being sealed interchangeably,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"A business that this night may execute,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I"
III,I,MORTIMER,"And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth"
III,I,MORTIMER,"To meet your father and the Scottish power,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury."
III,I,MORTIMER,"My father Glendower is not ready yet,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Not shall we need his help these fourteen days."
III,I,MORTIMER,"Within that space you may have drawn together"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And in my conduct shall your ladies come;"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"From whom you now must steal and take no leave,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"For there will be a world of water shed"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Upon the parting of your wives and you."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"In quantity equals not one of yours:"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"See how this river comes me cranking in,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And cuts me from the best of all my land"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And here the smug and silver Trent shall run"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"In a new channel, fair and evenly;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"It shall not wind with such a deep indent,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"To rob me of so rich a bottom here."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth."
III,I,MORTIMER,"Yea, but"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up"
III,I,MORTIMER,"With like advantage on the other side;"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Gelding the opposed continent as much"
III,I,MORTIMER,"As on the other side it takes from you."
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Yea, but a little charge will trench him here"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And on this north side win this cape of land;"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And then he runs straight and even."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I'll have it so: a little charge will do it."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I'll not have it alter'd."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Will not you?"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"No, nor you shall not."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Who shall say me nay?"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Why, that will I."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I can speak English, lord, as well as you;"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"For I was train'd up in the English court;"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Where, being but young, I framed to the harp"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Many an English ditty lovely well"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"A virtue that was never seen in you."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Marry,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And I am glad of it with all my heart:"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I had rather be a kitten and cry mew"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Nothing so much as mincing poetry:"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Come, you shall have Trent turn'd."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"To any well-deserving friend;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"The moon shines fair; you may away by night:"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I'll haste the writer and withal"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Break with your wives of your departure hence:"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"I am afraid my daughter will run mad,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"So much she doteth on her Mortimer."
III,I,MORTIMER,"Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I cannot choose: sometime he angers me"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And of a dragon and a finless fish,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"A couching lion and a ramping cat,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"He held me last night at least nine hours"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"In reckoning up the several devils' names"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"As a tired horse, a railing wife;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Than feed on cates and have him talk to me"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"In any summer-house in Christendom."
III,I,MORTIMER,"In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Exceedingly well read, and profited"
III,I,MORTIMER,"In strange concealments, valiant as a lion"
III,I,MORTIMER,"And as wondrous affable and as bountiful"
III,I,MORTIMER,"As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?"
III,I,MORTIMER,"He holds your temper in a high respect"
III,I,MORTIMER,"And curbs himself even of his natural scope"
III,I,MORTIMER,"When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:"
III,I,MORTIMER,"I warrant you, that man is not alive"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Might so have tempted him as you have done,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Without the taste of danger and reproof:"
III,I,MORTIMER,"But do not use it oft, let me entreat you."
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And since your coming hither have done enough"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To put him quite beside his patience."
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Defect of manners, want of government,"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The least of which haunting a nobleman"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Upon the beauty of all parts besides,"
III,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Beguiling them of commendation."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Here come our wives, and let us take our leave."
III,I,MORTIMER,"This is the deadly spite that angers me;"
III,I,MORTIMER,"My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars."
III,I,MORTIMER,"Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Shall follow in your conduct speedily."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"one that no persuasion can do good upon."
III,I,MORTIMER,"I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens"
III,I,MORTIMER,"I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"In such a parley should I answer thee."
III,I,MORTIMER,"I understand thy kisses and thou mine,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"And that's a feeling disputation:"
III,I,MORTIMER,"But I will never be a truant, love,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,"
III,I,MORTIMER,"With ravishing division, to her lute."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad."
III,I,MORTIMER,"O, I am ignorance itself in this!"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And rest your gentle head upon her lap,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And she will sing the song that pleaseth you"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"As is the difference betwixt day and night"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Begins his golden progress in the east."
III,I,MORTIMER,"With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:"
III,I,MORTIMER,"By that time will our book, I think, be drawn"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Do so;"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And those musicians that shall play to you"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap."
III,I,LADY PERCY,"Go, ye giddy goose."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"By'r lady, he is a good musician."
III,I,LADY PERCY,"Then should you be nothing but musical for you are"
III,I,LADY PERCY,"altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,"
III,I,LADY PERCY,"and hear the lady sing in Welsh."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish."
III,I,LADY PERCY,"Wouldst thou have thy head broken?"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"No."
III,I,LADY PERCY,"Then be still."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Neither;'tis a woman's fault."
III,I,LADY PERCY,"Now God help thee!"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"To the Welsh lady's bed."
III,I,LADY PERCY,"What's that?"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Peace! she sings."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Come, Kate, I'll have your song too."
III,I,LADY PERCY,"Not mine, in good sooth."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"'as sure as day,'"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"Come, sing."
III,I,LADY PERCY,"I will not sing."
III,I,HOTSPUR,"'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away"
III,I,HOTSPUR,"within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go."
III,I,GLENDOWER,"By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,"
III,I,GLENDOWER,"And then to horse immediately."
III,I,MORTIMER,"With all my heart."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"For we shall presently have need of you."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"I know not whether God will have it so,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"For some displeasing service I have done,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"That, in his secret doom, out of my blood"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"But thou dost in thy passages of life"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Make me believe that thou art only mark'd"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Could such inordinate and low desires,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Such barren pleasures, rude society,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Accompany the greatness of thy blood"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And hold their level with thy princely heart?"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"So please your majesty, I would I could"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Quit all offences with as clear excuse"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"As well as I am doubtless I can purge"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Myself of many I am charged withal:"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Yet such extenuation let me beg,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"As, in reproof of many tales devised,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I may, for some things true, wherein my youth"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Find pardon on my true submission."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"At thy affections, which do hold a wing"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Which by thy younger brother is supplied,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And art almost an alien to the hearts"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Of all the court and princes of my blood:"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"The hope and expectation of thy time"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Prophetically doth forethink thy fall."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Had I so lavish of my presence been,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"So stale and cheap to vulgar company,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Opinion, that did help me to the crown,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Had still kept loyal to possession"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And left me in reputeless banishment,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"A fellow of no mark nor likelihood."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"By being seldom seen, I could not stir"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"But like a comet I was wonder'd at;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"That men would tell their children 'This is he;'"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And dress'd myself in such humility"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Even in the presence of the crowned king."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"My presence, like a robe pontifical,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And won by rareness such solemnity."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"The skipping king, he ambled up and down"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Mingled his royalty with capering fools,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Had his great name profaned with their scorns"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And gave his countenance, against his name,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Of every beardless vain comparative,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Grew a companion to the common streets,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"They surfeited with honey and began"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"More than a little is by much too much."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"So when he had occasion to be seen,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"He was but as the cuckoo is in June,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"As, sick and blunted with community,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Afford no extraordinary gaze,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Such as is bent on sun-like majesty"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Slept in his face and render'd such aspect"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"As cloudy men use to their adversaries,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"For thou has lost thy princely privilege"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"With vile participation: not an eye"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"But is a-weary of thy common sight,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Which now doth that I would not have it do,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Make blind itself with foolish tenderness."
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Be more myself."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"For all the world"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"As thou art to this hour was Richard then"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And even as I was then is Percy now."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"He hath more worthy interest to the state"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Than thou the shadow of succession;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"For of no right, nor colour like to right,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And, being no more in debt to years than thou,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"To bloody battles and to bruising arms."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"What never-dying honour hath he got"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Whose hot incursions and great name in arms"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Holds from all soldiers chief majority"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And military title capital"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"This infant warrior, in his enterprises"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Enlarged him and made a friend of him,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"To fill the mouth of deep defiance up"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And shake the peace and safety of our throne."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Capitulate against us and are up."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Base inclination and the start of spleen"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"To fight against me under Percy's pay,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"To show how much thou art degenerate."
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Do not think so; you shall not find it so:"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And God forgive them that so much have sway'd"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I will redeem all this on Percy's head"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And in the closing of some glorious day"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Be bold to tell you that I am your son;"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"When I will wear a garment all of blood"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And stain my favours in a bloody mask,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"That this same child of honour and renown,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet."
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"For every honour sitting on his helm,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Would they were multitudes, and on my head"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"My shames redoubled! for the time will come,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"That I shall make this northern youth exchange"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"His glorious deeds for my indignities."
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Percy is but my factor, good my lord,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And I will call him to so strict account,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"That he shall render every glory up,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart."
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"This, in the name of God, I promise here:"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"The which if He be pleased I shall perform,"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I do beseech your majesty may salve"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"If not, the end of life cancels all bands;"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"And I will die a hundred thousand deaths"
III,II,PRINCE HENRY,"Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"A hundred thousand rebels die in this:"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed."
III,II,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"So hath the business that I come to speak of."
III,II,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word"
III,II,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"That Douglas and the English rebels met"
III,II,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury"
III,II,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"A mighty and a fearful head they are,"
III,II,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"If promises be kept on every hand,"
III,II,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"As ever offer'd foul play in the state."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"For this advertisement is five days old:"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Through Gloucestershire; by which account,"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Our business valued, some twelve days hence"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet."
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Our hands are full of business: let's away;"
III,II,KING HENRY IV,"Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay."

III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to"

III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"and had my pocket picked: this house is turned"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"bawdy-house; they pick pockets."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"What didst thou lose, Jack?"

III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"A trifle, some eight-penny matter."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"he would cudgel you."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"What! he did not?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed"

III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"go"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"Say, what thing? what thing?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"What thing! why, a thing to thank God on."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"call me so."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"otherwise."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"What beast! why, an otter."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"where to have her."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"ought him a thousand pound."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"a million: thou owest me thy love."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,Hostess,"cudgel you."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Did I, Bardolph?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,BARDOLPH,"Indeed, Sir John, you said so."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Yea, if he said my ring was copper."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"roaring of a lion's whelp."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"And why not as the lion?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"I do, I pray God my girdle break."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"were enriched with any other injuries but these, I"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"have more flesh than another man, and therefore more"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"It appears so by the story."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"prithee, be gone."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"lad, how is that answered?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"thee: the money is paid back again."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"I am good friends with my father and may do any thing."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"do it with unwashed hands too."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,BARDOLPH,"Do, my lord."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"laud them, I praise them."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"Bardolph!"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,BARDOLPH,"My lord?"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"o'clock in the afternoon."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"Money and order for their furniture."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"The land is burning; Percy stands on high;"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,PRINCE HENRY,"And either we or they must lower lie."
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!"
III,Scene III  Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.,FALSTAFF,"O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"In this fine age were not thought flattery,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Such attribution should the Douglas have,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"As not a soldier of this season's stamp"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Should go so general current through the world."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"The tongues of soothers; but a braver place"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord."
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Thou art the king of honour:"
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"No man so potent breathes upon the ground"
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"But I will beard him."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Do so, and 'tis well."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you."
IV,I,Messenger,"These letters come from your father."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Letters from him! why comes he not himself?"
IV,I,Messenger,"He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Under whose government come they along?"
IV,I,Messenger,"His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord."
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?"
IV,I,Messenger,"He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;"
IV,I,Messenger,"And at the time of my departure thence"
IV,I,Messenger,"He was much fear'd by his physicians."
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I would the state of time had first been whole"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Ere he by sickness had been visited:"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"His health was never better worth than now."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"The very life-blood of our enterprise;"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"'Tis catching hither, even to our camp."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"He writes me here, that inward sickness--"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"And that his friends by deputation could not"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"To lay so dangerous and dear a trust"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"On any soul removed but on his own."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"That with our small conjunction we should on,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"To see how fortune is disposed to us;"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"For, as he writes, there is no quailing now."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Because the king is certainly possess'd"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Of all our purposes. What say you to it?"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Your father's sickness is a maim to us."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Seems more than we shall find it: were it good"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"To set the exact wealth of all our states"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"All at one cast? to set so rich a main"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"It were not good; for therein should we read"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"The very bottom and the soul of hope,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"The very list, the very utmost bound"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Of all our fortunes."
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"'Faith, and so we should;"
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Where now remains a sweet reversion:"
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"We may boldly spend upon the hope of what"
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Is to come in:"
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A comfort of retirement lives in this."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"A rendezvous, a home to fly unto."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"If that the devil and mischance look big"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Upon the maidenhead of our affairs."
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"But yet I would your father had been here."
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The quality and hair of our attempt"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Brooks no division: it will be thought"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By some, that know not why he is away,"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And think how such an apprehension"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"May turn the tide of fearful faction"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And breed a kind of question in our cause;"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For well you know we of the offering side"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The eye of reason may pry in upon us:"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"This absence of your father's draws a curtain,"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That shows the ignorant a kind of fear"
IV,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Before not dreamt of."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"You strain too far."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"I rather of his absence make this use:"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"It lends a lustre and more great opinion,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"A larger dare to our great enterprise,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Than if the earl were here; for men must think,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"If we without his help can make a head"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"To push against a kingdom, with his help"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole."
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"As heart can think: there is not such a word"
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul."
IV,I,VERNON,"Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord."
IV,I,VERNON,"The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,"
IV,I,VERNON,"Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"No harm: what more?"
IV,I,VERNON,"And further, I have learn'd,"
IV,I,VERNON,"The king himself in person is set forth,"
IV,I,VERNON,"Or hitherwards intended speedily,"
IV,I,VERNON,"With strong and mighty preparation."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"And bid it pass?"
IV,I,VERNON,"All furnish'd, all in arms;"
IV,I,VERNON,"All plumed like estridges that with the wind"
IV,I,VERNON,"Baited like eagles having lately bathed;"
IV,I,VERNON,"Glittering in golden coats, like images;"
IV,I,VERNON,"As full of spirit as the month of May,"
IV,I,VERNON,"And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;"
IV,I,VERNON,"Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls."
IV,I,VERNON,"I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,"
IV,I,VERNON,"His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd"
IV,I,VERNON,"Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,"
IV,I,VERNON,"And vaulted with such ease into his seat,"
IV,I,VERNON,"As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,"
IV,I,VERNON,"To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus"
IV,I,VERNON,"And witch the world with noble horsemanship."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"They come like sacrifices in their trim,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"All hot and bleeding will we offer them:"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"O that Glendower were come!"
IV,I,VERNON,"There is more news:"
IV,I,VERNON,"I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,"
IV,I,VERNON,"He cannot draw his power this fourteen days."
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet."
IV,I,WORCESTER,"Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"What may the king's whole battle reach unto?"
IV,I,VERNON,"To thirty thousand."
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Forty let it be:"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"My father and Glendower being both away,"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"The powers of us may serve so great a day"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Come, let us take a muster speedily:"
IV,I,HOTSPUR,"Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily."
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Talk not of dying: I am out of fear"
IV,I,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Of death or death's hand for this one-half year."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight."
IV,II,BARDOLPH,"Will you give me money, captain?"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"Lay out, lay out."
IV,II,BARDOLPH,"This bottle makes an angel."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end."
IV,II,BARDOLPH,"I will, captain: farewell."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"their services; and now my whole charge consists of"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"the rooms of them that have bought out their"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"services, that you would think that I had a hundred"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"together and thrown over the shoulders like an"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge."
IV,II,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"at Shrewsbury."
IV,II,WESTMORELAND,"Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were"
IV,II,WESTMORELAND,"there, and you too; but my powers are there already."
IV,II,WESTMORELAND,"The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must"
IV,II,WESTMORELAND,"away all night."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"steal cream."
IV,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath"
IV,II,PRINCE HENRY,"already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose"
IV,II,PRINCE HENRY,"fellows are these that come after?"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"Mine, Hal, mine."
IV,II,PRINCE HENRY,"I did never see such pitiful rascals."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"tush, man, mortal men, mortal men."
IV,II,WESTMORELAND,"Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor"
IV,II,WESTMORELAND,"and bare, too beggarly."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"learned that of me."
IV,II,PRINCE HENRY,"No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on"
IV,II,PRINCE HENRY,"the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is"
IV,II,PRINCE HENRY,"already in the field."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"What, is the king encamped?"
IV,II,WESTMORELAND,"He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long."
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"Well,"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast"
IV,II,FALSTAFF,"Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"We'll fight with him to-night."
IV,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It may not be."
IV,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"You give him then the advantage."
IV,III,VERNON,"Not a whit."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Why say you so? looks he not for supply?"
IV,III,VERNON,"So do we."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"His is certain, ours is doubtful."
IV,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight."
IV,III,VERNON,"Do not, my lord."
IV,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"You do not counsel well:"
IV,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"You speak it out of fear and cold heart."
IV,III,VERNON,"Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,"
IV,III,VERNON,"And I dare well maintain it with my life,"
IV,III,VERNON,"If well-respected honour bid me on,"
IV,III,VERNON,"I hold as little counsel with weak fear"
IV,III,VERNON,"As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:"
IV,III,VERNON,"Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle"
IV,III,VERNON,"Which of us fears."
IV,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Yea, or to-night."
IV,III,VERNON,"Content."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"To-night, say I."
IV,III,VERNON,"Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,"
IV,III,VERNON,"Being men of such great leading as you are,"
IV,III,VERNON,"That you foresee not what impediments"
IV,III,VERNON,"Drag back our expedition: certain horse"
IV,III,VERNON,"Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:"
IV,III,VERNON,"Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;"
IV,III,VERNON,"And now their pride and mettle is asleep,"
IV,III,VERNON,"Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,"
IV,III,VERNON,"That not a horse is half the half of himself."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"So are the horses of the enemy"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"In general, journey-bated and brought low:"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"The better part of ours are full of rest."
IV,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The number of the king exceedeth ours:"
IV,III,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in."
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"I come with gracious offers from the king,"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"You were of our determination!"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Some of us love you well; and even those some"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Envy your great deservings and good name,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Because you are not of our quality,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"But stand against us like an enemy."
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"And God defend but still I should stand so,"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"So long as out of limit and true rule"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"You stand against anointed majesty."
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"But to my charge. The king hath sent to know"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"The nature of your griefs, and whereupon"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"You conjure from the breast of civil peace"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Audacious cruelty. If that the king"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Have any way your good deserts forgot,"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Which he confesseth to be manifold,"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"You shall have your desires with interest"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"And pardon absolute for yourself and these"
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Herein misled by your suggestion."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"The king is kind; and well we know the king"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Knows at what time to promise, when to pay."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"My father and my uncle and myself"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Did give him that same royalty he wears;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"And when he was not six and twenty strong,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"My father gave him welcome to the shore;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"And when he heard him swear and vow to God"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"To sue his livery and beg his peace,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"My father, in kind heart and pity moved,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Swore him assistance and perform'd it too."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Now when the lords and barons of the realm"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"The more and less came in with cap and knee;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Even at the heels in golden multitudes."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"He presently, as greatness knows itself,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Steps me a little higher than his vow"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Made to my father, while his blood was poor,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Some certain edicts and some strait decrees"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"This seeming brow of justice, did he win"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"The hearts of all that he did angle for;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Proceeded further; cut me off the heads"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Of all the favourites that the absent king"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"In deputation left behind him here,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"When he was personal in the Irish war."
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Tut, I came not to hear this."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Then to the point."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"In short time after, he deposed the king;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Soon after that, deprived him of his life;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Who is, if every owner were well placed,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"There without ransom to lie forfeited;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Disgraced me in my happy victories,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Sought to entrap me by intelligence;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Rated mine uncle from the council-board;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"And in conclusion drove us to seek out"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"This head of safety; and withal to pry"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Into his title, the which we find"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Too indirect for long continuance."
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Shall I return this answer to the king?"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Some surety for a safe return again,"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"And in the morning early shall my uncle"
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"Bring him our purposes: and so farewell."
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"I would you would accept of grace and love."
IV,III,HOTSPUR,"And may be so we shall."
IV,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Pray God you do."
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"With winged haste to the lord marshal;"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To whom they are directed. If you knew"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"How much they do to import, you would make haste."
IV,IV,SIR MICHAEL,"My good lord,"
IV,IV,SIR MICHAEL,"I guess their tenor."
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Like enough you do."
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"As I am truly given to understand,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The king with mighty and quick-raised power"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"What with the sickness of Northumberland,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Whose power was in the first proportion,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Who with them was a rated sinew too"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"I fear the power of Percy is too weak"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To wage an instant trial with the king."
IV,IV,SIR MICHAEL,"Why, my good lord, you need not fear;"
IV,IV,SIR MICHAEL,"There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer."
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"No, Mortimer is not there."
IV,IV,SIR MICHAEL,"But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,"
IV,IV,SIR MICHAEL,"And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head"
IV,IV,SIR MICHAEL,"Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen."
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The special head of all the land together:"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And moe corrivals and dear men"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Of estimation and command in arms."
IV,IV,SIR MICHAEL,"Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed."
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For he hath heard of our confederacy,"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Therefore make haste. I must go write again"
IV,IV,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael."
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"How bloodily the sun begins to peer"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"At his distemperature."
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"The southern wind"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"And by his hollow whistling in the leaves"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Foretells a tempest and a blustering day."
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Then with the losers let it sympathize,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"For nothing can seem foul to those that win."
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"That you and I should meet upon such terms"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"And made us doff our easy robes of peace,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"This is not well, my lord, this is not well."
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"What say you to it? will you again unknit"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"And move in that obedient orb again"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Where you did give a fair and natural light,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"And be no more an exhaled meteor,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"A prodigy of fear and a portent"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of broached mischief to the unborn times?"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Hear me, my liege:"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For mine own part, I could be well content"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To entertain the lag-end of my life"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"With quiet hours; for I do protest,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I have not sought the day of this dislike."
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"You have not sought it! how comes it, then?"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it."
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Peace, chewet, peace!"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It pleased your majesty to turn your looks"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of favour from myself and all our house;"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And yet I must remember you, my lord,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We were the first and dearest of your friends."
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For you my staff of office did I break"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In Richard's time; and posted day and night"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"When yet you were in place and in account"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Nothing so strong and fortunate as I."
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It was myself, my brother and his son,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That brought you home and boldly did outdare"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The dangers of the time. You swore to us,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To this we swore our aid. But in short space"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And such a flood of greatness fell on you,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What with our help, what with the absent king,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What with the injuries of a wanton time,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The seeming sufferances that you had borne,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And the contrarious winds that held the king"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"So long in his unlucky Irish wars"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That all in England did repute him dead:"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And from this swarm of fair advantages"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"You took occasion to be quickly woo'd"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To gripe the general sway into your hand;"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And being fed by us you used us so"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That even our love durst not come near your sight"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Out of sight and raise this present head;"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Whereby we stand opposed by such means"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As you yourself have forged against yourself"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And violation of all faith and troth"
V,I,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Sworn to us in your younger enterprise."
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"These things indeed you have articulate,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"To face the garment of rebellion"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"With some fine colour that may please the eye"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Which gape and rub the elbow at the news"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of hurlyburly innovation:"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"And never yet did insurrection want"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Such water-colours to impaint his cause;"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Nor moody beggars, starving for a time"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Of pellmell havoc and confusion."
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"In both your armies there is many a soul"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"This present enterprise set off his head,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"I do not think a braver gentleman,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"More active-valiant or more valiant-young,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"More daring or more bold, is now alive"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"To grace this latter age with noble deeds."
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"For my part, I may speak it to my shame,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"I have a truant been to chivalry;"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"And so I hear he doth account me too;"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Yet this before my father's majesty--"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"I am content that he shall take the odds"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Of his great name and estimation,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"And will, to save the blood on either side,"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Try fortune with him in a single fight."
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Albeit considerations infinite"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"We love our people well; even those we love"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"That are misled upon your cousin's part;"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"And, will they take the offer of our grace,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Both he and they and you, every man"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"So tell your cousin, and bring me word"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"What he will do: but if he will not yield,"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Rebuke and dread correction wait on us"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"And they shall do their office. So, be gone;"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"We will not now be troubled with reply:"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"We offer fair; take it advisedly."
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"It will not be accepted, on my life:"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"The Douglas and the Hotspur both together"
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Are confident against the world in arms."
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"For, on their answer, will we set on them:"
V,I,KING HENRY IV,"And God befriend us, as our cause is just!"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"me, so; 'tis a point of friendship."
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship."
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Say thy prayers, and farewell."
V,I,FALSTAFF,"I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well."
V,I,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, thou owest God a death."
V,I,FALSTAFF,"'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"his day. What need I be so forward with him that"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no."
V,I,FALSTAFF,"Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no."
V,I,FALSTAFF,"Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"to the dead. But will it not live with the living?"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so"
V,I,FALSTAFF,"ends my catechism."
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The liberal and kind offer of the king."
V,II,VERNON,"'Twere best he did."
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Then are we all undone."
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It is not possible, it cannot be,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The king should keep his word in loving us;"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"He will suspect us still and find a time"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To punish this offence in other faults:"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For treason is but trusted like the fox,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Will have a wild trick of his ancestors."
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Look how we can, or sad or merrily,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Interpretation will misquote our looks,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The better cherish'd, still the nearer death."
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And an adopted name of privilege,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"All his offences live upon my head"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And on his father's; we did train him on,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And, his corruption being ta'en from us,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all."
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In any case, the offer of the king."
V,II,VERNON,"Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so."
V,II,VERNON,"Here comes your cousin."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"My uncle is return'd:"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Uncle, what news?"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The king will bid you battle presently."
V,II,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so."
V,II,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Marry, and shall, and very willingly."
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"There is no seeming mercy in the king."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Did you beg any? God forbid!"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I told him gently of our grievances,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By now forswearing that he is forsworn:"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"With haughty arms this hateful name in us."
V,II,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown"
V,II,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,"
V,II,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;"
V,II,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on."
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,"
V,II,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And, nephew, challenged you to single fight."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"And that no man might draw short breath today"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?"
V,II,VERNON,"No, by my soul; I never in my life"
V,II,VERNON,"Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,"
V,II,VERNON,"Unless a brother should a brother dare"
V,II,VERNON,"To gentle exercise and proof of arms."
V,II,VERNON,"He gave you all the duties of a man;"
V,II,VERNON,"Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,"
V,II,VERNON,"Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,"
V,II,VERNON,"Making you ever better than his praise"
V,II,VERNON,"By still dispraising praise valued in you;"
V,II,VERNON,"And, which became him like a prince indeed,"
V,II,VERNON,"He made a blushing cital of himself;"
V,II,VERNON,"And chid his truant youth with such a grace"
V,II,VERNON,"As if he master'd there a double spirit."
V,II,VERNON,"Of teaching and of learning instantly."
V,II,VERNON,"There did he pause: but let me tell the world,"
V,II,VERNON,"If he outlive the envy of this day,"
V,II,VERNON,"England did never owe so sweet a hope,"
V,II,VERNON,"So much misconstrued in his wantonness."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Cousin, I think thou art enamoured"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"On his follies: never did I hear"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Of any prince so wild a libertine."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"But be he as he will, yet once ere night"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"That he shall shrink under my courtesy."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Better consider what you have to do"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Can lift your blood up with persuasion."
V,II,Messenger,"My lord, here are letters for you."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"I cannot read them now."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"O gentlemen, the time of life is short!"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"To spend that shortness basely were too long,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"If life did ride upon a dial's point,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Still ending at the arrival of an hour."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"An if we live, we live to tread on kings;"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"If die, brave death, when princes die with us!"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"When the intent of bearing them is just."
V,II,Messenger,"My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"For I profess not talking; only this--"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Let each man do his best: and here draw I"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"A sword, whose temper I intend to stain"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"With the best blood that I can meet withal"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"In the adventure of this perilous day."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on."
V,II,HOTSPUR,"Sound all the lofty instruments of war,"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"And by that music let us all embrace;"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall"
V,II,HOTSPUR,"A second time do such a courtesy."
V,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"What is thy name, that in the battle thus"
V,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek"
V,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Upon my head?"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Know then, my name is Douglas;"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And I do haunt thee in the battle thus"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Because some tell me that thou art a king."
V,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"They tell thee true."
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner."
V,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;"
V,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"And thou shalt find a king that will revenge"
V,III,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Lord Stafford's death."
V,III,HOTSPUR,"O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,"
V,III,HOTSPUR,"never had triumph'd upon a Scot."
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king."
V,III,HOTSPUR,"Where?"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Here."
V,III,HOTSPUR,"This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:"
V,III,HOTSPUR,"A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;"
V,III,HOTSPUR,"Semblably furnish'd like the king himself."
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?"
V,III,HOTSPUR,"The king hath many marching in his coats."
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,"
V,III,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Until I meet the king."
V,III,HOTSPUR,"Up, and away!"
V,III,HOTSPUR,"Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day."
V,III,FALSTAFF,"Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate."
V,III,FALSTAFF,"Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"they are for the town's end, to beg during life."
V,III,FALSTAFF,"But who comes here?"
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:"
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff"
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,"
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,"
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"lend me thy sword."
V,III,FALSTAFF,"O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile."
V,III,FALSTAFF,"Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure."
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,"
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"lend me thy sword."
V,III,FALSTAFF,"Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt."
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"Give it to me: what, is it in the case?"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city."
V,III,PRINCE HENRY,"What, is it a time to jest and dally now?"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes"
V,III,FALSTAFF,"unlooked for, and there's an end."
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"I prithee,"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much."
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him."
V,IV,LANCASTER,"Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I beseech your majesty, make up,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Lest your retirement do amaze your friends."
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"I will do so."
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent."
V,IV,WESTMORELAND,"Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!"
V,IV,LANCASTER,"We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,"
V,IV,LANCASTER,"Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"But now, I do respect thee as my soul."
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"With lustier maintenance than I did look for"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"Of such an ungrown warrior."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"O, this boy"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Lends mettle to us all!"
V,IV,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:"
V,IV,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I am the Douglas, fatal to all those"
V,IV,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"That wear those colours on them: what art thou,"
V,IV,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"That counterfeit'st the person of a king?"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"So many of his shadows thou hast met"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"And not the very king. I have two boys"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"Seek Percy and thyself about the field:"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"I will assay thee: so, defend thyself."
V,IV,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I fear thou art another counterfeit;"
V,IV,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:"
V,IV,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,"
V,IV,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And thus I win thee."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Never to hold it up again! the spirits"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Who never promiseth but he means to pay."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Cheerly, my lord how fares your grace?"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight."
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"Stay, and breathe awhile:"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,"
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"O God! they did me too much injury"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"That ever said I hearken'd for your death."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"If it were so, I might have let alone"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"The insulting hand of Douglas over you,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Which would have been as speedy in your end"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"As all the poisonous potions in the world"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"And saved the treacherous labour of your son."
V,IV,KING HENRY IV,"Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey."
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name."
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"My name is Harry Percy."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, then I see"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"A very valiant rebel of the name."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"To share with me in glory any more:"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Nor can one England brook a double reign,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales."
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"To end the one of us; and would to God"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"And all the budding honours on thy crest"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll crop, to make a garland for my head."
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"I can no longer brook thy vanities."
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"boy's play here, I can tell you."
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"I better brook the loss of brittle life"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"And time, that takes survey of all the world,"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"But that the earthy and cold hand of death"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust"
V,IV,HOTSPUR,"And food for--"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"When that this body did contain a spirit,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"A kingdom for it was too small a bound;"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"But now two paces of the vilest earth"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Bears not alive so stout a gentleman."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"If thou wert sensible of courtesy,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I should not make so dear a show of zeal:"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"But let my favours hide thy mangled face;"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"For doing these fair rites of tenderness."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"But not remember'd in thy epitaph!"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I could have better spared a better man:"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"If I were much in love with vanity!"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Though many dearer, in this bloody fray."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Till then in blood by noble Percy lie."
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too."
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"perfect image of life indeed. The better part of"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"valour is discretion; in the which better part I"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"afraid he would prove the better counterfeit."
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me."
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"Therefore, sirrah,"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Thy maiden sword."
V,IV,LANCASTER,"But, soft! whom have we here?"
V,IV,LANCASTER,"Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I did; I saw him dead,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"thou alive?"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st."
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"earl or duke, I can assure you."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead."
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"believed, so; if not, let them that should reward"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword."
V,IV,LANCASTER,"This is the strangest tale that ever I heard."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"This is the strangest fellow, brother John."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours."
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,"
V,IV,PRINCE HENRY,"To see what friends are living, who are dead."
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and"
V,IV,FALSTAFF,"live cleanly as a nobleman should do."
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke."
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Pardon and terms of love to all of you?"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Three knights upon our party slain to-day,"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"A noble earl and many a creature else"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Had been alive this hour,"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Betwixt our armies true intelligence."
V,V,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What I have done my safety urged me to;"
V,V,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And I embrace this fortune patiently,"
V,V,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Since not to be avoided it falls on me."
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Other offenders we will pause upon."
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"How goes the field?"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"The noble Percy slain, and all his men"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"And falling from a hill, he was so bruised"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"That the pursuers took him. At my tent"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"I may dispose of him."
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"With all my heart."
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"This honourable bounty shall belong:"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"Go to the Douglas, and deliver him"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"His valour shown upon our crests to-day"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds"
V,V,PRINCE HENRY,"Even in the bosom of our adversaries."
V,V,LANCASTER,"I thank your grace for this high courtesy,"
V,V,LANCASTER,"Which I shall give away immediately."
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Then this remains, that we divide our power."
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March."
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Meeting the cheque of such another day:"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"And since this business so fair is done,"
V,V,KING HENRY IV,"Let us not leave till all our own be won."
